# Kiosk

First ensure node version 16 is installed. First in kiosk folder do:

```
npm install
```

## config.json settings

These settings apply only to the kiosk user experience and do not impact sim gameplay. It's assumed all gamepads use the same configuration.

|Key|Purpose|
|---------------------------------|-|
|GameDataUrl                      | Path to the game data JSON file with details about the games to include.|
|PlayUrlRoot                      | Left part of the embedded player URL up to and including --run.|
|Debug                            | Uses debug settings, such as figuring out where the game data URL is in production vs. local debugging.|
|HighScoresToKeep                 | The maximum number of high scores to keep for a given game.|
|HighScoreInitialsLength          | The number of initials to allow users to enter.|
|HighScoreInitialAllowedCharacters| The list and order of characters to allow in high scores.|
|GamepadPollLoopMilli             | How often the gamepads are polled for user interaction with the kiosk menus and other inputs. If this is too large, actions may be missed, such as a quick button press. If it's too small, then a single action may be interpretted as multiple (like a single button press counting twice).|
|GamepadCacheMilli                | How often the gamepad state is cached. Since multiple components access the browser's Navigator.getGamepads() API, we use a caching mechanism to optimize how often they're accessed. This value should be smaller than the gamepad polling loop.|
|GamepadAButtonPin                | The pin index for the A button. |
|GamepadBButtonPin                | The pin index for the B button.|
|GamepadEscapeButtonPin           | The pin index for the Escape button. This button leaves a game without waiting and returns the user to the menu.|
|GamepadResetButtonPin            | The pin index for the Reset button.|
|GamepadMenuButtonPin             | The pin index for the Menu button. Note that since this menu is used by games, it does not return the user to the kiosk menu. |
|GamepadLeftRightAxis             | The gamepad axis index for left/right detection.|
|GamepadLeftRightThreshold        | The threshold to detect for a "right" action. It's negated to detect "left" actions.|
|GamepadUpDownAxis                | The gamepad axis index for up/down detection.|
|GamepadUpDownThreshold           | The threshold to detect for a "down" action. It's negated to detect "up" actions.|
|Keyboard`Input`Keys              | Each is an array of string arrays matching the browser keys that map to the target behavior. The index of a list maps to the same gamepad index (player 1 is the first array at index 0, etc.) |

## Localhost testing

npm run start
```

## Deploy
