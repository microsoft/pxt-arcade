# Bug Arena Back and Forth

## Bug Arena: Back-and-Forth Algorithm @showdialog

Welcome to the üëæ **Bug Arena** üëæ where the smartest bugs battle for glory!

![Bug Arena Back and Forth](/static/skillmap/bug-arena/back-and-forth.gif "animation of back and forth pattern")

üí° Smart decision to pick this algorithm - millions of lawn mowers can't be wrong! üöú

Follow these directions to code your bug's AI algorithm ‚ú® to move back and forth across the screen.

## Set direction

Our bug moves on its own, but it's important to make sure that it starts out moving in the right direction! üó∫Ô∏è

From the ``||hourOfAi:Hour of AI||`` Toolbox category, drag a ``||hourOfAi:face towards 0||`` block out and drop into the ``||hourOfAi:on start||`` block.

``||hourOfAi:Face towards||`` will turn your bug to face a specific angle in degrees where:
- 0 = right
- 90 = down
- 180 = left
- 270 = up

![Face towards degrees](/static/skillmap/bug-arena/degrees.png "face towards degrees")

So our bug will start off moving towards the right side of the screen.

```blocks
hourOfAi.onStart(function () {
    hourOfAi.turnTowards(0)
})
```

## üß± Bump wall

In the Game Window üñºÔ∏è in the bottom right corner, click on the  **Practice** button.

Then select **No Opponent** and **Infinite**.

Do you see your bug move to the right?  Nice! üòä But what happens when your bug gets to the other side of the screen?

Nothing ü•∫ So let's add some code for when it hits a wall.

From the ``||hourOfAi:Hour of AI||`` category, drag an ``||hourOfAi:on bump wall||`` block out onto the Workspace - you can put it anywhere.

```blocks
hourOfAi.onBumpWall(function () {

})
```

## Turn 90 degrees

From the ``||hourOfAi:Hour of AI||`` category, drag a ``||hourOfAi:turn 90||`` block and drop it into the ``||hourOfAi:on bump wall||`` block.

The turn block ‚Ü©Ô∏è will turn our bug a certain number of degrees. A positive number ‚ûï is clockwise, and a negative number ‚ûñ is counter-clockwise.

![Turn angle](/static/skillmap/bug-arena/turn-angle.png "turn angle")

```blocks
hourOfAi.onBumpWall(function () {
    hourOfAi.turnBy(90)
})
```

## ‚¨áÔ∏è Move down

In this case, we want to turn our bug 90 degrees so it's facing down ‚§µÔ∏è, move a bit ‚¨áÔ∏è, then turn another 90 degrees so it's facing back the way we came. ‚Ü©Ô∏è

To do that, we need to use a block that will wait a certain amount of time ‚è±Ô∏è before turning again.

From the ``||hourOfAi:Hour of AI||`` category, drag a ``||hourOfAi:run after 500 ms||`` block out and drop it after the ``||hourOfAi:turn 90||`` block.

In the ``||hourOfAi:run after 500 ms||`` block, click on the **500** ms drop-down and change to **1 second**, or 1000 milliseconds (ms).

~hint What does this do?

---

The ``||hourOfAi:run after||`` block will run the code inside of it after waiting a specified amount of time ‚è≥.  In this case, we are going to wait 1 second until we turn around again.

hint~

```blocks
hourOfAi.onBumpWall(function () {
    hourOfAi.turnBy(90)
    hourOfAi.doAfter(1000, function () {
 
    })
})
```

## ‚Ü©Ô∏è Now turn around

From the ``||hourOfAi:Hour of AI||`` category, drag another ``||hourOfAi:turn 90||`` block out and drop it into the ``||hourOfAi:run after||`` block.

```blocks
hourOfAi.onBumpWall(function () {
    hourOfAi.turnBy(90)
    hourOfAi.doAfter(1000, function () {
        hourOfAi.turnBy(90)
    })
})
```

## üöú Let's mow!

Let's test our AI algorithm to see how it performs. üí´

Look in the üïπÔ∏è Game Window.  What happens? 

Our bug does go back and forth, but it just keeps moving back and forth at the top of the screen! ‚û°Ô∏è‚¨ÖÔ∏è

How do we make our bug keep moving down ‚¨áÔ∏è so it fills in the whole arena?

## Create a variable

We need to change the direction our bug is turning each time it hits a wall - at first it turns towards the right (90 degrees), and then we want it to turn towards the left (-90 degrees), and so on. ‚ÜîÔ∏è

To do that, let's first create a variable. üè∑Ô∏è

~hint What is a variable?

---

A **variable** is like a container ü™£ that holds a value. Variables have names so you can easily reference them in your program. And the values inside variables may change.

hint~

Open the ``||Variables:Variables||`` category in the Toolbox and click on **Make a Variable**.  

Name the variable **angle**.

Now from the ``||Variables:Variables||`` category, drag a ``||Variables:set angle to||`` block into the ``||hourOfAi:on start||`` block.

Type in **-90** as the value for the angle variable, replacing **0**.

```blocks
let angle = 0
hourOfAi.onStart(function () {
    hourOfAi.turnTowards(0)
    angle = -90
})
```

## Multiply by -1

To change back and forth between 90 and -90 degrees, we'll multiply ‚úñÔ∏è by -1.

Drag another ``||Variables:set angle to||`` block into the top of the ``||hourOfAi:on bump wall||`` block.

From the ``||Math:Math||`` Toolbox category, drag out a ``||Math:multiplication (0 x 0)||`` block and drop into the ``||Variables:set angle to||`` block replacing the **0**.

From the ``||Variables:Variables||`` category, drag an ``||Variables:angle||`` block out and drop into the ``||Math:multiplication||`` block replacing the first **0**.

Type in **-1** for the second value in the ``||Math:multiplication||`` block.

```blocks
hourOfAi.onBumpWall(function () {
    angle = angle * -1
    hourOfAi.turnBy(90)
    hourOfAi.doAfter(1000, function () {
        hourOfAi.turnBy(90)
    })
})
```

## Turn angle

Now we need to replace our 90 degree turns with our ``||Variables:angle||`` variable. üè∑Ô∏è

From the ``||Variables:Variables||`` category, drag two ``||Variables:angle||`` blocks out and drop one into each ``||hourOfAi:turn||`` block replacing the **90** degrees.

```blocks
hourOfAi.onBumpWall(function () {
    angle = angle * -1
    hourOfAi.turnBy(angle)
    hourOfAi.doAfter(1000, function () {
        hourOfAi.turnBy(angle)
    })
})
```

## üéâ Great job! üéâ

Test your game again in the üïπÔ∏è Game Window.

You can move the slider to the right ‚û°Ô∏è to watch your bug go back and forth filling the screen with glorious paint! üé®

Nice work! ‚≠ê You've coded a smart AI algorithm ‚ú® that will mow down üçÉ your competitors in the Bug Arena!

Move on to the üè∞ Tower Battle to challenge your Bug rivals!

```blocks

    hourOfAi.turnTowards(0)
    angle = -90

hourOfAi.onBumpWall(function () {
    angle = angle * -1
    hourOfAi.turnBy(angle)
    hourOfAi.doAfter(1000, function () {
        hourOfAi.turnBy(angle)
    })
})
