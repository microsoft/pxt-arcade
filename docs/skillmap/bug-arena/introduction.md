# Bug Arena Introduction

## ✨ AI Challenge Accepted! @showdialog

Welcome to the 👾 **Bug Arena** 👾 where the smartest bugs battle for glory!

![Bug Arena Gameplay](/static/skillmap/bug-arena/game.gif "animation of game")

Get ready to code your own super-smart bug using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and challenge other AI bugs to see who rules the arena!

Your mission: splash your bug's paint 🎨 all over the screen and out-color 🖌️ your rivals. The more you cover, the closer you are to victory!

Look on the left for instructions 📝 - they'll tell you what to do.

In the middle is the Toolbox 🧰.  Drag out code blocks from here and assemble on the Workspace 🧩 to build your program.

The Game Window 🕹️ is in the bottom right corner.  This is where you can play and test your game.  

## Practice mode

Go to the Game Window 🖼️ (bottom right corner) and click on the **Practice** button.

You can pick **No Opponent** or select from various different challengers 💪 to train your bug's AI.

Then click to select a **Timed Match** or **Infinite** to play without a clock. 🕓

Click **Next** below for more information about the game screen.

## Game screen

In the game screen, your bug will always start in the top left corner of the screen.

At the top of the screen you'll see graphs showing you the percentage of the screen covered by your paint and your opponent's paint.

If you selected a Timed Match, you will also see a clock timer 🕓 at the top. In Practice mode, there is no time limit.

Speed things up or slow them down using the ⚡ Speed slider at the bottom of the screen.

Watch them zoom around! The bugs move on their own, thanks to their smart ✨ AI brains.

## ⚔️ Tower Battle

In the Game Window 🖼️, click on the **Menu** button to return to the main menu.

## ✨ Artificial Intelligence

In the next tutorial, you'll learn how to give your bug a set of instructions called an **algorithm**.

~hint What is an Algorithm?

---

An **algorithm** is a set of rules or instructions 📋 that tell a computer 💻 what to do.

hint~

When you code an algorithm for your bug, you're giving it **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** so it can move and think for itself.  

~hint What is AI?

---

**AI**, or **artificial intelligence**, is when computers or robots 🤖 are made to think and learn like people. 🤔  

**AI Agents** are smart computer programs that work on their own to do tasks, make decisions, and reach goals. ✨👤

## Types of Algorithms @showdialog

![Example Algorithms](/static/skillmap/bug-arena/algorithms.gif "animation of 3 types of algorithms")

- Scribble
- Squares
- Back and forth

After you click Done ✅, select your next tutorial based on the type of coloring algorithm you want to use for your bug.
