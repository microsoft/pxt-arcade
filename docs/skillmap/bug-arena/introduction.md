## ✨ AI Challenge Accepted! @showdialog

Welcome to the 👾 **Bug Arena** 👾 where the smartest bugs battle for glory!

![Bug Arena Gameplay](/static/skillmap/bug-arena/game.gif "animation of game")

This first tutorial will introduce you to the mechanics of the Bug Arena game. You won't be doing any coding, but you'll get ready to create your own super-smart bug using **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and challenge other AI bugs to see who rules the arena!

Your mission: splash your bug's paint 🎨 all over the screen and out-color 🖌️ your rivals. The more you cover, the closer you are to victory!

## Practice mode

Go to the Game Window 🖼️ (bottom right corner) and click on the **Practice** button.

You can pick No Opponent or select from various different challengers 💪 to train your bug's AI. To unlock more opponents, battle them in the Tower.

Click on **Waftsworth** as your practice opponent.

Then click to select a **Timed Match**. Infinite mode allows you to play without a clock.

Click **Next** below for more information about the game screen.

## Game screen

In the game screen, your bug will always start in the top left corner of the screen.

At the top of the screen you'll see graphs showing you the percentage of the screen covered by your paint and your opponent's paint.

If you selected a Timed Match, you will also see a clock timer 🕓 at the top. In Practice mode, there is no time limit.

Speed things up or slow them down using the **SPEED** slider at the bottom of the screen.

Watch them zoom around! The bugs move on their own, thanks to their smart ✨ AI brains.

## ⚔️ Tower Battle

In the Game Window 🖼️, click on the **Menu** button to return to the main menu.

When you have finished training your AI bug, clicking on the **Tower** button will allow you to battle other bugs and climb the Tower for ultimate Bug Arena glory! 🏆

You will learn more about the Tower in the last Bug Arena tutorial.

## ✨ Artificial Intelligence

In the next tutorial, you'll learn how to give your bug a set of instructions called an **algorithm**.

~hint What is an Algorithm?

---

An **algorithm** is a set of rules or instructions 📋 that tell a computer 💻 what to do.

hint~

When you code an algorithm for your bug, you're giving it **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** so it can move and think for itself.  

~hint What is AI?

---

**AI**, or **artificial intelligence**, is when computers or robots 🤖 are made to think and learn like people. 🤔  

**AI Agents** are smart computer programs that work on their own to do tasks, make decisions, and reach goals. ✨👤

## Types of Algorithms
