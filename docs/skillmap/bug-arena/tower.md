Now that you've trained your bug's AI Algorithm ✨, it's time to put it to the test.

Battle other AI bugs in the Tower 🏰 and level up with every win! Can you reach the top and become the Bug Arena champion? 👑

## How to play

In the Game Window 🖼️ in the bottom right corner, click on the **Tower** button to start the game.

At each level, you will be introduced to your 👾 bug opponents and will challenge them to a bug paint 🎨 splash duel!

Each duel lasts 5 minutes, so feel free to move the ⚡️ Speed slider to the right ➡️ to speed things up.

If you win the match 🏆, you'll move up a level in the Tower to challenge your next opponent.

If you lose ❌, you'll have an option to go back to the Practice grounds refine your AI algorithm and Continue, or you can start a New Game from the bottom.
