# Bug Arena Learning Outcomes

**A page for Educators & Parents**

The **Bug Arena** skillmap introduces students to Artificial Intelligence (AI) through a fun, iterative, game-based learning approach.

In this set of activities, students will code their own AI Bug using a variety of different algorithms. They can then compete against other AI bugs to cover the screen with paint.

This skillmap is designed for students between the ages of 8 and 15 years old and takes approximately 45 minutes (including game play) to complete.  No previous coding background is required and students will not be exposed to an AI chatbot through this experience.

There are 3 required tutorials and 2 additional optional tutorials. At the end of the learning path, students will receive a certificate of completion and a badge.

|  Tutorial                 | Duration   |  Description |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Introduction              | 7 minutes  | Students gain familiarity with the MakeCode interface, learn how to play the Bug Arena game, and are introduced to key AI concepts and terms. |
| Random Algorithm*         | 8 minutes  | Students learn how to code a Random algorithm for their bug.  ([solution](https://makecode.com/_YHA76faXLVgx)) |
| Squares Algorithm*        | 10 minutes | Students learn how to code an algorithm for their bug to move in concentric squares.  ([solution]( https://makecode.com/_HFrcvoUYaMg7)) |
| Back-and-Forth Algorithm* | 11 minutes | Students learn how to code an algorithm for their bug to move back and forth across the screen.  ([solution]( https://makecode.com/_aipRXiJfsX6T)) |
| Tower Battle              | 2 minutes  | Students will take the AI algorithms they have created and compete with other AI bugs in the Tower. |

\* Students should select one of the algorithms to complete before moving on to the Tower.

**Notes**:
- Duration is approximate based on time to follow instructions as written. Providing extra time for creativity, debugging and game play is encouraged!
- When selecting from the three provided algorithms, they are ordered from easiest to hardest: Random, Squares, and Back-and-Forth.

## Learning Objectives

This activity was designed to align with the [AI Literacy Framework](https://ailiteracyframework.org) empowering students to engage and create with AI in positive, meaningful ways that further their technical skills and understanding in order to thrive in a world influenced by AI.

This activity covers the following competencies of AI Literacy:

**Engaging with AI**
- Evaluate whether AI outputs should be accepted, revised, or rejected
- Examine how predictive AI systems can inform and limit perspectives

**Creating with AI**
- Use AI systems to explore new perspectives and approaches that build upon original ideas
- Collaborate with AI systems to elicit feedback, refine results, and reflect on thought processes
- Explain how AI systems perform tasks using precise language that avoids anthropomorphism

**Designing AI**
- Describe how AI systems can be designed to support a solution to a community problem
- Evaluate AI systems using defined criteria, expected outcomes, and user feedback
- Describe an AI model's purpose, intended users, and its limitations

## Code definitions

### On Start

![On Start](/static/skillmap/bug-arena/onstart.png "on start")

The code inside the **On Start** block will run as soon as the program starts.

### Every

![Every](/static/skillmap/bug-arena/every.png "every")

The code inside the **Every** block will run on a specified millisecond (ms) time interval.

### On Bump Wall

![On Bump Wall](/static/skillmap/bug-arena/onbumpwall.png "on bump wall")

The code inside the **On Bump Wall** block will run when the bug bumps into a wall.

### Turn

![Turn](/static/skillmap/bug-arena/turn.png "turn")

Will turn the bug a specified number of degrees from its current direction. A positive number is clockwise, a negative number is counter-clockwise.

![Turn angle](/static/skillmap/bug-arena/turn-angle.png "turn angle")

### Face Towards

![Face Towards](/static/skillmap/bug-arena/facetowards.png "face towards")

Will turn the bug to face a specific angle in degrees where: 0 = right, 90 = down, 180 = left, 270 = up

![Face towards degrees](/static/skillmap/bug-arena/degrees.png "face towards degrees")

### Run After

![Run After](/static/skillmap/bug-arena/runafter.png "run after")

Will wait a specified amount of time in milliseconds (ms) before running the code inside it.

### Distance to Color

![Distance to Color](/static/skillmap/bug-arena/distancetocolor.png "distance to color")

Will return the distance in pixels from the front of the bug to its own paint color.

### Pick Random

![Pick Random](/static/skillmap/bug-arena/pickrandom.png "pick random")

Will return a random whole number between a minimum and maximum value.

## Game Mod Ideas

Once students have completed the Bug Arena skillmap, they can modify (mod) their programs using the full MakeCode editor. Use the **[SAVE TO MY PROJECTS]** button in the Skillmap to continue editing the code. 

Mod Suggestions: 

- Add music or sound effects
- Add screen effects
- Try using different algorithm strategies to beat the Tower

## What's Next?

When students are finished with **Bug Arena** consider encouraging them to complete another skillmap.
