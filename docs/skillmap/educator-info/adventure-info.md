# Whack-the-Mole

**A page for Educators & Parents**

The **Whack-the-Mole** skillmap introduces simple game design and computer science concepts through a fun, relatable carnival interface.

In this set of activities, students will create a simple mole-chasing game with MakeCode Arcade.  This map is intended for students who are new to MakeCode with little or no previous coding experience.

Designed for students between the ages of 8 & 13, this experience contains a total of 3 tutorials (approximating 45 minutes of instruction).  At the end of the learning path, students receive a certificate of completion and a badge.

|                 | Minutes* |  Key Concepts |
| --------------- | -------- |  ------------ |
| Mole Hunt    |18  |  sprites, events, timer |
| Hammer Time   |12 |  sprites, overlaps, events |
| Get Animated   |15  |  sound, text, animations |


\* Minutes are approximate, based on time to follow instructions as written. Providing extra time for creativity and debugging is encouraged.

### Objectives

After completing Whack-the-Mole, students will have gained exposure to all the elements they need to successfully create their own Whack-the-Mole game using MakeCode Arcade, including:

#### Computer Science Concepts

- Sequencing and algorithms
- Events
- User input


#### Game Design Concepts

- Sprites
- Design, Sounds, and Effects
- Collision / overlap
- Countdown timers
- Game Score
- Win/Loss Criteria
- Animation

#### 3. Get Animated

| Activity | Get Animated (15 min) |
|---|---|
| ![Get Animated thumbnail](/static/skillmap/mole/mole3.gif) | Add sound and animation to polish your game! |
| Blocks used | ``[music.knock.play()]`` <br/> ``[animation.runImageAnimationHammer(myHammer,[img`.`],100,false)]`` <br/>``[scene.add_label_to("Whack-the-Mole", areas.Bottom)]`` |
| Solution option | [Get Animated Project](https://makecode.com/_PCKW94TVLMpA) |







##### Game Mod Ideas

After students complete Whack-the-Mole they can head back to the skillmap and click "SAVE TO MY PROJECTS", which will open the game in a window with a full-featured toolbox. Here are some modifications they can try:

- Change the mole to a different character. Try a monster, an alien, or a star!
- Animate your character each time it's tagged by the rubber hammer.
- Add background music.
