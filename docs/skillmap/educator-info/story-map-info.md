# About the "Full of Stories" Skillmap

**A page for Educators & Parents**

The **Full of Stories** skillmap introduces the most common types of code blocks used throughout MakeCode Arcade.

In this set of activities, students will create creative storytelling projects with MakeCode Arcade.  This map is intended for students who are new to MakeCode with little or no previous coding experience.  Through step-by-step instructions, students will focus on projects that range from greeting cards, to jokes, to full short stories.

Designed for students between the ages of 10 & 15, this experience contains a total of 4 tutorials (approximating 120 minutes of instruction) spread over 3 sessions.  At the end of the learning path, students receive a certificate of completion.
