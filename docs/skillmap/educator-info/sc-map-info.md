This map introduces a number of MakeCode Arcade game design elements.

In this set of activities, students will create their very own platformer game with MakeCode Arcade.  This guide is intended for students who are new to MakeCode with little or no previous coding experience.  Through step-by-step instructions, students will create an amazing adventure based on the movie Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings! Guided by an intro-level tutorial, they will use code to train Shang-Chi or Xialing to build magic platforms, seek out mystical rings, and battle assassins from the Ten Rings organization.
