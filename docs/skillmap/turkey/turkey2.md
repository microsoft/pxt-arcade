## Welcome @showdialog

**In this tutorial, we'll show you how to add code to rescue the turkeys in the cages.**

![Playing to rescue turkeys as you jump](/static/skillmap/turkey/turkey2.gif "Can you save them all?")



## {2. Try It!}

**Look at the game window.**

- :binoculars: Look at your project in the game window to see what we're starting with.

You should be able to move your turkey from side to side with the arrows and make it jump
from platform to platform using the A button (or the space bar.)


~hint My game doesn't work ⚠️

---

If your code isn't working and you can't figure out why, click
<br/>"Replace my code"<br/>
to replace the blocks in your workspace with new starter code.

hint~




## {3. Rescue the Others}

**Turkey to the rescue!**<br/>
🦃 🦃 🦃

When the player overlaps a **cage** tile, let's trigger some code.

---

- :tree: From the ``||scene:Scene||`` category, drag
```blocks
scene.onOverlapTile(SpriteKind.Player, assets.tile`transparency17`, function (sprite, location) {
    info.changeScoreBy(1)
})
```
into **an empty area** of the workspace.


- :paint brush: Click the checkerboard image and change it to the **cage** tile.
![Pick the cage tile](/static/skillmap/turkey/cage-tile.png "Choose the second non-empty tile")


#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
scene.onOverlapTile(SpriteKind.Player, assets.tile`cage`, function (sprite, location) {
    info.changeScoreBy(1)
})
```

## {4. Try It Again!}

- :binoculars: Check your game window!

Guide your turkey to a cage.  What happens when the two overlap?

Which block do you think causes your points to increase?



## {5. Too Many Points}

**Uh oh!  You get WAY too many points when you overlap a cage.**

We can fix that by replacing the cage with an empty tile once you reach it.

---

- :tree: From ``||scene:Scene||``, drag
```block
    tiles.setTileAt(location, assets.tile`transparency17`)
```
into **the end** of the<br/>
``||scene(noclick):on [sprite] of kind [Player] overlaps [cage] at [location]||``<br/>
container.


#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
scene.onOverlapTile(SpriteKind.Player, assets.tile`cage`, function (sprite, location) {
    info.changeScoreBy(1)
    //@highlight
    tiles.setTileAt(location, assets.tile`transparency17`)
})
```



## {6. Play Again!}

- :binoculars: Test your project again!

You should get one point for each cage you grab.  Can you find all 15?



## {7. Gather an Army}

**You have the start of a very nice game!**

Each time you overlap a cage, let's make a new turkey follow you to freedom!

---

- :paper plane: From ``||sprites:Sprites||``, drag
```block
    let freeTurkeys = sprites.create(img`.`, SpriteKind.Rescued)
```
into **the end** of the<br/>
``||scene(noclick):on [sprite] of kind [Player] overlaps [cage] at [location]||``<br/>
container.


- :paint brush: Click the empty grey square and switch to
**MyAssets** to choose the little **turkey** sprite.
![Pick the smaller turkey sprite](/static/skillmap/turkey/little-turkey.png "Choose the smaller turkey")


```blockconfig.local
    let freeTurkeys = sprites.create(img`.`, SpriteKind.Rescued)
```

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
namespace SpriteKind {
    export const Rescued = SpriteKind.create()
}

scene.onOverlapTile(SpriteKind.Player, assets.tile`cage`, function (sprite, location) {
    info.changeScoreBy(1)
    tiles.setTileAt(location, assets.tile`transparency17`)
    //@highlight
    let freeTurkeys = sprites.create(turkey_imgs.lil, SpriteKind.Rescued)
})
```


## {8. Appear}

**You've added little turkeys, but we can't see them.**

Let's set each new turkey to appear in the same place where the cage disappeared.

---

- :tree: From ``||scene:Scene||``, drag
```block
    tiles.placeOnTile(freeTurkeys, location)
```
into **the end** of the
``||scene(noclick):on [sprite] of kind [Player] overlaps [cage] at [location]||``
container.


```blockconfig.local
    let freeTurkeys = sprites.create(img`.`, SpriteKind.Rescued)
```

#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
namespace SpriteKind {
    export const Rescued = SpriteKind.create()
}

scene.onOverlapTile(SpriteKind.Player, assets.tile`cage`, function (sprite, location) {
    info.changeScoreBy(1)
    tiles.setTileAt(location, assets.tile`transparency17`)
    let freeTurkeys = sprites.create(turkey_imgs.lil, SpriteKind.Rescued)
    //@highlight
    tiles.placeOnTile(freeTurkeys, location)
})
```


## {9. Play!}

- :binoculars: Test your project!

A little turkey should appear each time you overlap a cage.

Keep following the instructions to find out how to get the little turkeys to 
follow you to freedom.

```blockconfig.local
    let freeTurkeys = sprites.create(img`.`, SpriteKind.Rescued)
```


## {10. Be Free!}

**Leave no turkeys behind!**

- :paper plane: From ``||sprites:Sprites||``, drag
```block
let freeTurkeys: Sprite = null
freeTurkeys.follow(sprite)
```
into **the end** of the <br/>
``||scene(noclick):on [sprite] of kind [Player] overlaps [cage] at [location]||``<br/>
container.


```blockconfig.local
    let freeTurkeys = sprites.create(img`.`, SpriteKind.Rescued)
```


#### ~ tutorialhint
```blocks
namespace SpriteKind {
    export const Rescued = SpriteKind.create()
}

scene.onOverlapTile(SpriteKind.Player, assets.tile`cage`, function (sprite, location) {
    info.changeScoreBy(1)
    tiles.setTileAt(location, assets.tile`transparency17`)
    let freeTurkeys = sprites.create(turkey_imgs.lil, SpriteKind.Rescued)
    tiles.placeOnTile(freeTurkeys, location)
    //@highlight
    freeTurkeys.follow(sprite)
})
```


## {11. Play}

- :binoculars: Play your game!

Each turkey you rescue should follow you as you make your way to the top.



## {Finale}

When you're finished playing, click **Done** to return to the
main skillmap. Keep going and find out how to add the ability to WIN!

corner for the share button.
