# Get Moving


## Introduction @showdialog

Time to get your turkey moving and jumping!

![An anigif of the game we're about to build](/static/skillmap/turkey/turkey1.gif "Look what we're about to do today!")


## 2. Check Your Code

**Your code from the last activity should be in your workspace.**

If you don't see any code in your workspace, or if the code in your workspace
doesn't show a turkey on your screen, you can replace the existing code with ours
by clicking **"Replace my code"** at the bottom of the instruction panel.


---

- :mouse pointer: Click **Next** to see how to control your player!


## 3. Control the Player

**Let's make your turkey move using the arrow buttons!**<br/>
_(Don't forget to keep scrolling until you reach the bottom of this instruction.)_

---

- :game: From the ``||controller: Controller||`` category in the toolbox, drag <br/>
``||controller:move [mySprite] with buttons ‚äï||`` <br/>
to **the end** of the ``||loops:on start||`` container that's already in the workspace.


- :mouse pointer: Press the **+** button to the right of the block and change
the
[__*vy*__](#whatVY "vertical velocity") (up/down speed)
argument to **0** so that the player won't hover up or down when you use the joypad.


<details>
<summary>What is **vy**?</summary>
In short, **vy** stands for "the **velocity** along the **y** axis," which refers
to the rate of change of the sprite from top to bottom. By setting this value to **0**,
the sprite will not be able to move up or down.
</details>


<details>
<summary>Show me how to complete these steps.</summary>
![Move with controls](/static/skillmap/turkey/move-sprite.gif "Add the move sprite block")
</details>

- :mouse pointer: Click **Next** when you're ready to try your game.


```blocks
let mySprite = sprites.create(assets.image`player`, SpriteKind.Player)
// @highlight
controller.moveSprite(mySprite, 100, 0)
```


## 4. Try It

**Click the Game Console **

The turkey should move left when you click the left arrow and move
right with the right arrow, but it should not move up or down.

<details>
<summary>How do I get to the game console?</summary>
![Here's where to look for the game window](/static/skillmap/turkey/game.gif "The workspace is on the right.")
</details>

- :mouse pointer: Click **Next** when you're ready to add gravity.



## 5. Add gravity

**To make the game playable, the world needs gravity.**

For that, add [__*acceleration*__](#accel "increased speed in a direction")
to "pull down" on the sprite.

---

- :paper plane:  From the ``||sprites:Sprites||`` category in the toolbox, drag <br/>
``||sprites:set [mySprite] [x] to [0]||`` <br/>
to **the end** of the <br/>
``||loops:on start||`` container in the workspace.

- :mouse pointer: Click the dropdown to change ``||sprites:x||`` to
``||sprites:ay (acceleration y)||``.

- :mouse pointer: To pull the sprite quickly toward the ground,
replace **0** with something large, like **500**.


<details>
<summary>What is **ay**?</summary>
In short, **ay** stands for "the **acceleration** along the **y** axis," which refers
to the change in speedfrom top to bottom. <br/>
By setting this value
to **500**, the sprite will be pulled from the top of the screen to the bottom, with an above average strength.
</details>


<details>
<summary>Show me how to complete these steps.</summary>
![Move with controls](/static/skillmap/turkey/acceleration.gif "Add the move sprite block")
</details>

- :mouse pointer: Click **Next** when you're ready to follow your turkey off-screen.


```blocks
let mySprite = sprites.create(assets.image`player`, SpriteKind.Player)
controller.moveSprite(mySprite, 100, 0)
// @highlight
mySprite.ay = 500
```

## 6. Follow with Camera

**Oops!  The turkey falls below the bottom of the screen!**

---

- :tree:  To keep the turkey in sight, open ``||scene: Scene||``, then drag <br/>
``||scene:camera follow sprite [mySprite]||`` <br/>
to **the end** of the <br/>
``||loops:on start||`` container.


- :mouse pointer: Click **Next** to see what happens now!


```blocks
let mySprite = sprites.create(assets.image`player`, SpriteKind.Player)
controller.moveSprite(mySprite, 100, 0)
mySprite.ay = 500
// @highlight
scene.cameraFollowSprite(mySprite)

```


## 7. Look Again

üïπÔ∏è üïπÔ∏è üïπÔ∏è

**Look at the game window to make sure you can see the turkey land on the platform.**



## 8. Start at the Bottom

The turkey has landed, but it's already near the top of the play area!
Let's start it on a special tile on the ground.

---

- :tree: From the ``||scene:Scene||`` category, drag the <br/>
``||scene:place [mySprite] on top of random [ ]||`` <br/>
block into **the end** of the <br/>
``||loops:on start||`` container.

- :mouse pointer: Click the checkered square and select the **start** tile,
which looks like a purple line at the bottom of the square.

![the start tile](/static/skillmap/turkey/start-tile.png "the tile where the turkey should start")


<details>
<summary>What is a tile?</summary>
A tile is a special 16px x 16px image square
that can be used as a part of the background scene.
Several of these tile squares are put together into one large **tilemap** that acts as the
backdrop for this game!
</details>


<details>

![Start the turkey on a tile](/static/skillmap/turkey/start-tile.gif "Choose the tile where the turkey should start")
</details>

- :mouse pointer: Click **Next** when you're ready make the turkey jump!

```blocks
let mySprite = sprites.create(assets.image`player`, SpriteKind.Player)
controller.moveSprite(mySprite, 100, 0)
mySprite.ay = 500
scene.cameraFollowSprite(mySprite)
//@highlight
tiles.placeOnRandomTile(mySprite, assets.tile`start`)
```

## 9. Jump

Now that the turkey is at the bottom of the game,
we need to make it jump using the **A** button!

---

- :game: From ``||controller:Controller||``, drag the <br/>
``||controller:on [A] button [pressed]||`` <br/>
container into an empty area of the workspace.

- :paper plane: Inside of the <br/>
``||controller:on [A] button [pressed]||`` <br/>
container, add <br/>
``||sprites:set [mySprite] [x] to [0]||``.

- :mouse pointer: Change ``||sprites:[x]||`` to ``||sprites:[vy (velocity y)]||``
so you can temporarily change the direction the turkey is traveling.

- :mouse pointer: Change **0** to **-300** to send the turkey upward with each press of the (A) button!



<details>
<summary>Show me how to complete these steps.</summary>
![Add a jump on A press](/static/skillmap/turkey/jump.gif "Here's how to send the turkey upward")
</details>

- :mouse pointer: Click **Next** when you're ready to give your game a try!

```blocks
let mySprite: Sprite = null

controller.A.onEvent(ControllerButtonEvent.Pressed, function () {
    mySprite.vy = -300
})
```

## Finale

üî• **That's it! Now try playing your game!** üî•
Can you get the turkey to the top?

Take a spin through the level, then click **Done**
to return to the main skillmap and go on to the next
activity where we'll show you how to rescue the other turkeys from their cages!

let mySprite = sprites.create(assets.image`player`, SpriteKind.Player)
