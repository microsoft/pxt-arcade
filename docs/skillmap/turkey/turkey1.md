# Move the Turkey


## Welcome @showdialog

Happy **Turkey Day!**

This activity will show you how to make a jumpy 
[__*platformer*__](#plat "games that rely on jump and run as their main mechanic").

![An anigif of the game we're about to build](/static/skillmap/turkey/turkey1.gif "Look what we're about to do today!")

Let's get started!



## 2. See the Scene

**Your scene has already been set!**

---

- :binoculars: Look at your workspace to see that the **background color** and 
**tilemap** have already been set for the scene in this activity.

_💡 Both blocks have been added to the 
``||loops: on start||`` container so they 
load as soon as the game starts.)_



## 3. We need a HERO

**Where's the turkey??**

Our moving characters are called 
[__*sprites*__](#sprote "2-D images that move on the screen"). 
Let's create a main turkey sprite and get it moving before we do anything else.

---

- :paper plane: From the ``||sprites:Sprites||`` category, 
drag   
``||variables(sprites):set [mySprite] to sprite [ ] of kind [Player]||``  
to **the end** of the ``||loops:on start||`` container.

_💡  Having trouble finding the block you need? 
Look to the left of the instructions for the icon 
of the toolbox category where your block lives!_

- :paint brush: To choose the main turkey, click the empty grey box, 
then toggle to **My Assets** and click the first turkey named **player**.

![Pick player from My Assets](/static/skillmap/turkey/pick-player.gif "Toggle to My Assets and choose player")

```blocks
scene.setBackgroundColor(9)
tiles.setTilemap(tilemap`level1`)
// @highlight
let mySprite = sprites.create(assets.image`player`, SpriteKind.Player)
```


## 4. Control the Player

**Time to get the player moving**  
↔

---

- :game: Drag    
``||controller:move [mySprite] with buttons ⊕||``  
to **the end** of the ``||loops:on start||`` container.

_💡  Remember, the icon to the left of the instructions shows the same icon as 
the toolbox category for the block you need._

- :mouse pointer: Press the ⊕ button to the right of the block and change 
the   
[__*vy*__](#whatVY "vertical velocity") (up/down speed)  
argument to **0** so that the player won't hover up or down when you use the joypad.


```blocks
scene.setBackgroundColor(9)
tiles.setTilemap(tilemap`level1`)
let mySprite = sprites.create(assets.image`player`, SpriteKind.Player)
// @highlight
controller.moveSprite(mySprite, 100, 0)
```


## 5. Try It

**Check the Game Window**  

The turkey should move left when you click the left arrow and move right with the right arrow.


## 6. Add gravity

**To make the game playable, it needs gravity.**

For that, add [__*acceleration*__](#accel "increased speed in a direction")
to "pull down" on the sprite.

---

- :paper plane:  Drag  
``||sprites:set [mySprite] [x] to [0]||``  
to **the end** of the  
``||loops:on start||`` container.

- :mouse pointer: Click the dropdown to change **x** to **ay (acceleration y)**.

- :mouse pointer: To pull the sprite quickly toward the ground, 
replace **0** with something large, like **500**.

```blocks
scene.setBackgroundColor(9)
tiles.setTilemap(tilemap`level1`)
let mySprite = sprites.create(assets.image`player`, SpriteKind.Player)
controller.moveSprite(mySprite, 100, 0)
// @highlight
mySprite.ay = 500
```

## 7. Follow with Camera

**Oops!  The turkey falls off-screen!**

---

- :tree:  To keep the turkey in sight, drag  
``||scene:camera follow sprite [mySprite]||``  
to **the end** of the  
``||loops:on start||`` container.

```blocks
scene.setBackgroundColor(9)
tiles.setTilemap(tilemap`level1`)
let mySprite = sprites.create(assets.image`player`, SpriteKind.Player)
controller.moveSprite(mySprite, 100, 0)
mySprite.ay = 500
// @highlight
scene.cameraFollowSprite(mySprite)

```


## 8. Look Again

🕹️ 🕹️ 🕹️  
**Look at the game window to make sure you can see the turkey land on a platform.**



## 9. Start at the Bottom

The turkey landed, but it's already near the top of the tilemap! 
Let's start it on a special tile on the ground.

---

- :tree: Drag the  
``||scene:place [mySprite] on top of random [ ]||``  
block into **the end** of the  
``||loops:on start||`` container.

- :mouse pointer: Click the checkered square and select the **start** tile, 
which looks like a purple line at the bottom of the square.



```blocks
scene.setBackgroundColor(9)
tiles.setTilemap(tilemap`level1`)
let mySprite = sprites.create(assets.image`player`, SpriteKind.Player)
controller.moveSprite(mySprite, 100, 0)
mySprite.ay = 500
scene.cameraFollowSprite(mySprite)
//@highlight
tiles.placeOnRandomTile(mySprite, assets.tile`start`)
```

## 10. Jump

Now that the turkey is at the bottom of the game, 
we need to make it jump using the **A** button!

---

- :game: Drag the  
``||controller:on [A] button [pressed]||``  
container into an empty area of the workspace.

- :paper plane: Inside of the  
``||controller:on [A] button [pressed]||``  
container, add  
``||sprites:set [mySprite] [x] to [0]||``.

- :mouse pointer: Change ``||sprites:[x]||`` to ``||sprites:[vy (velocity y)]||`` 
so you can temporarily change the direction the turkey is traveling.

- :mouse pointer: Change **0** to **-300** to send the turkey upward with each press of the (A) button!

```blocks
let mySprite: Sprite = null

controller.A.onEvent(ControllerButtonEvent.Pressed, function () {
    mySprite.vy = -300
})
```

## Finale

🔥 **That's it! Now give your game a try!** 🔥  
Can you make it to the top?

---

Take a spin through the level, then click **Done** 
to return to the main skillmap and go on to the next 
activity where we'll show you how to rescue the turkeys from their cages!




```template
namespace SpriteKind {
    export const Rescued = SpriteKind.create()
