# Leaps and Bounds


## Welcome @showdialog

**Right now, the game never ends.**  
We need a way to trigger a win!

![Anigif showing the turkey winning](/static/skillmap/turkey/turkey3.gif "Win or Lose!")



## 2. Try It!

**First, play the game in the game window.**  
🕹️ 🕹️ 🕹️ 

---

You should be able to move your player left and right with the arrows, and jump with the (A) button.  You should also be getting points with each turkey you release from its cage. 



## 3. Finding Freedom

**Let's add a way to win when your turkey gets to the purple tiles at the top!**

---

- :tree: Drag a new  
``||scene:on [sprite] of kind [Player] overlaps [ ] at [location]||``  
container into the workspace.

- :paint brush: This time, change the checkerboard to the solid purple tile.

- :circle: Snap a  
``||game:game over <LOSE>||``  
block into the new container and toggle
the **`<LOSE>`** switch to **`<WIN>`**!


```blocks
scene.onOverlapTile(SpriteKind.Player, sprites.swamp.swampTile16, function (sprite, location) {
    //@highlight
    game.over(true)
})
```

## 4. Play Your Game!

You should win the game as soon as your turkey makes it to the purple tiles.



## 5. It's Time!


**Let's add a way to lose if you don't make it to the top quickly enough.**

---


- :info: To set a countdown timer, drag  
``||info: start countdown [10] (s)||``  
into **the end** of the ``||loops: on start||`` container.

- :mouse pointer: Change **10** to **120** so that you have about 2 minutes to escape.


```blocks
let mySprite: Sprite = null
scene.setBackgroundColor(9)
tiles.setTilemap(tilemap`level1`)
mySprite = sprites.create(assets.image`player`, SpriteKind.Player)
controller.moveSprite(mySprite, 100, 0)
mySprite.ay = 500
scene.cameraFollowSprite(mySprite)
tiles.placeOnRandomTile(mySprite, assets.tile`start`)
//@highlight
info.startCountdown(120)
})
```


## 6. Time's Up!


**When the timer runs out, end the game with a loss.**

---


- :info: Drag a  
``||info: on countdown end||``   
contaner into an empty area of the workspace.


- :circle: Snap a  
``||game:game over <LOSE>||``  
block into the new container.


```blocks
info.onCountdownEnd(function () {
    game.over(false)
})
```


## 7. Play Your Game!

**Give it a try in the game window.**

---

Can you make it to the purple tiles at the top before the timer expires?

How many turkeys can you save along the way?



## Finale

**Play your game and see how many turkeys you can save!**
