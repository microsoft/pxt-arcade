## The Shortest Story

Once upon a time, there was a lizard who lived beneath a toadstool.

Next door, there lived a butterfly on a daisy.

Every day, the butterfly would sweep past the lizard and taunt him from the sky.

"Ha ha!" He would say. "Your house doesn't smell as good as mine."

Finally, one day, the lizard decided to find a daisy of her own.

She tried and tried, but she just couldn't get comfortable.

No matter what she did, the fragrant flower didn't make her happy.

The next day, the lizard moved back to her toadstool and lived happily ever after.
