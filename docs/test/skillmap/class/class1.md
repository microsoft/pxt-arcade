This is Miss Kiki's Class. Nothing ever feels quite normal in this school.

**Ready to start coding?**

Our main character is called a sprite. Let's create a student sprite and get them moving before we do anything else.


~hint What's a sprite? ðŸ’¡

---

In Arcade, each character or image that does something is called a **SPRITE**.

Sprites have properties that you can use and change â€” things like scale, position, and lifespan are all properties of sprites.

Our "student" character will be a sprite, too.
