# Harlem Globetrotters

## A BRIEF HISTORY

![Brief History banner](/static/skillmap/globetrotters/history-banner.png)

Once upon a time, almost a hundred years ago, a basketball team was born that would 
change the world of sports forever. This wasn't just any team; this was the Harlem
Globetrotters!

But guess what? Even though they are called the "Harlem" Globetrotters, they didn't
actually start in Harlem, New York. They began their journey in the 1920s in Chicago,
Illinois. A man named Abe Saperstein decided to form a team that would not only play
basketball but would also entertain people with dazzling tricks, incredible shots,
and a lot of humor.

The Harlem Globetrotters were not just great athletes; they were performers, too!
They would spin basketballs on their fingers, make long shots from half-court, and
even from beyond, and perform funny skits in the middle of their games. Their games
were a mix of sports and theater, and people had never seen anything like it!

As they traveled from place to place, the Globetrotters broke many barriers. They
were among the first teams to play basketball internationally, showcasing their
skills all around the world. Not only did they win games, but they also won hearts,
bringing joy and laughter to everyone who watched them.

Now, decades later, the Harlem Globetrotters are a symbol of fun, skill, and the
magic that happens when you blend sports with entertainment. They are more than
basketball players; they are entertainers, ambassadors of joy, and true legends of
the game.

As you step into the world of coding to create a game around this historic team,
remember, you are not just working with a basketball team, but with a team that
brought smiles to people's faces and showed the world a brand-new way to play
basketball. Get ready to sprinkle a bit of that Globetrotters' magic into your
own game!
