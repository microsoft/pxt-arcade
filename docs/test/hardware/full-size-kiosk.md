## Cut list

All units are in inches and degree angles. Add 1/4" to the length when a miter is present, 1/2" when 2 miters are present.

You will also need to cut out the 2 sides of the arcade cabinet.

## Cut Instructions

* Using your profile template, mark 2 profiles on the plywood and cut with a jigsaw.

![Cutting the template](/static/hardware/raspberry-pi/wooden-cabinet/cuttemplate.jpg)

* The cuts do not have to be perfect as the router will clean it up.

![Rough edges](/static/hardware/raspberry-pi/wooden-cabinet/roughedges.jpg)

* Use a router to clean the edges.

![Route edges](/static/hardware/raspberry-pi/wooden-cabinet/routeedges.jpg)

* Cut and miter all the cuts set aside.

## Assembly instructions

* Create 2 jigs that let you position boards 1/4" from the side.
* Cut out various 1" x 1/2" strips needed to secure the boards.

For each board,

* Cut out 2 strips and glue/pin them to the side.
* Use the jig to position the boards 1/4" from the sides.

Once all the boards are secured, attach the upper side of the arcade and you're done!

## Control panel

Follow the wiring instructions of the [cardboard control panel](/hardware/raspberry-pi/cardboard-control-panel) to wire the buttons and joysticks to the raspberry pi.

## Screen

* Place the screen on the wood panel and mark the position where the screen touches the wood.
* Pin nail the attachments to clamp the screen down.
* Drill holes to allow power and HDMI cables to pass through the back of the screen.

To make it easier, we recommend building a jig to position and build this part.
