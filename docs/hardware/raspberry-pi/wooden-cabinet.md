* **1** - 22" monitor with HDMI input (i.e.  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072F3DL6P)
* Joystick and button controls for 2 players.  These will vary depending on whether you will be powering your Arcade with a Windows computer, or a Raspberry Pi.
  *  Windows – see https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware/shoebox-controller
  *  Raspberry Pi – see https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware/raspberry-pi
* Paint, decals, chalkboard paper (https://www.amazon.com/s?k=chalkboard+paper) or other materials to decorate

## Template

Cut out this template precisely and keep it as your master template for all future cuts.

## Cut list

All units are in inches and degree angles. Add 1/4" to the length when a miter is present, 1/2" when 2 miters are present.

| Thickness | Width | Length   | Location | Miter Angle
| --------- | ----- | -------- | -------- | -------
| 1/2       | 23    | 59 3/4   | K        | 22 1/2
| 1/2       | 23    | 24 7/8   | B        | 0

| 1/2       | 23    | 5        | D        | 25

You will also need to cut out the 2 sides of the arcade cabinet.

## Cut Instructions

* Using your profile template, mark 2 profiles on the plywood and cut with a jigsaw.

![Cutting the template](/static/hardware/raspberry-pi/wooden-cabinet/cuttemplate.jpg)

* The cuts do not have to be perfect as the router will clean it up.

![Rough edges](/static/hardware/raspberry-pi/wooden-cabinet/roughedges.jpg)

* Use a router to clean the edges.

![Route edges](/static/hardware/raspberry-pi/wooden-cabinet/routeedges.jpg)

* Cut and miter all the cuts set aside.

## Assembly instructions

* Create 2 jigs that let you position boards 1/4" from the side.
* Cut out various 1" x 1/2" strips needed to secure the boards.

For each board, 

* Cut out 2 strips and glue/pin them to the side.
* Use the jig to position the boards 1/4" from the sides.

Once all the boards are secured, attach the upper side of the arcade and you're done!

## Control panel

Follow the wiring and assembly instructions for the joysticks and buttons depending on whether you will be powering your Arcade machine with a Windows computer, or a Raspberry Pi Zero.
* Windows – use an old Windows laptop or a PC stick device (i.e.  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LYRQZ59) with Arcade Kiosk Mode (https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware/kiosk).  See Shoebox controller project (https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware/shoebox-controller) for control assembly.
* Raspberry Pi Zero – see https://arcade.makecode.com/hardware/raspberry-pi for wiring instructions.

## Screen

* Place the screen on the wood panel and mark the position where the screen touches the wood.
* Pin nail the attachments to clamp the screen down.
* Drill holes to allow power and HDMI cables to pass through the back of the screen.

To make it easier, we recommend building a jig to position and build this part.

## Decoration

This is your cabinet, have fun decorating it and personalize it the way you like! We used the
[Arcade Stencilr](https://riknoll.github.io/arcade-stenciler/) to generate stencils and drawing on our cabinets.
