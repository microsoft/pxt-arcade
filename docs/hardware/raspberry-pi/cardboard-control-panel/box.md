# Prepping the cardboard box

Find a cardboard box large enough to hold your buttons and joystick. If you have purchased a computer monitor for the arcade, use the box from the screen.

## Reinforcement

We recommend add 1 or 2 layers of cardboard on the surface that will hold the buttons and joystick.

- [ ] cut out additional cardboard sheets.

- [ ] use a glue gun to attach them to the control panel surface.

## Button layout

Use a marker to **trace** where your buttons and joysticks will go on the box.

For the buttons, use the black plastic ring to trace their size; for the joystick, remove the stick if needed to trace them.

#### Where should my buttons go?

We purposely did not provide precise measurements in order to encourage you to create your own layout.

* are my buttons too far apart?
* should buttons be aligned or slightly diagonal?

## Holes

For best results, we recommend using a drill bit and a cordless drill. You could also use manual cardboard
cutting tools but it is hard to achieve a perfect hole cut.

- [ ] use a 1" bit to drill the holes for the buttons and joystick stick.

- [ ] drill 1 additional hole in the center to pass the wires.

- [ ] use a screwdriver or the blade of the scissor to cut a **small** hole on the corner of the joystick.
The hole should be large enough to let a **zip tie** go through (or a machine screw).

### Fresh paint!

If you plan to paint or customize your control panel, **now** is a great time to do it... Before it gets populated with the electronics.

## ~

- [ ] try squeezing a few buttons and zip ties in the holes. If they don't fit it, try rotating them in just like a screw.

- [ ] cut an access door at the back to allow easier wiring later on
