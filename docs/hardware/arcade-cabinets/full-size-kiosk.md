#### WARNING: Power Tools required

To complete this project as written, you will need access to power tools and a CNC machine. If you don't have a CNC machine available, you can take the SVG files to a local printhouse to have full-size vinyl patterns made.

Make sure to follow all safety procedures or ask a professional for help.

## Suggested Tools

* CNC or jigsaw, router, table saw, impact driver, wood glue, etc... The kind of tools you find in a wood shop.


## Template

This [SVG template](/hardware/arcade-cabinets/cabinet.svg) will serve as the outline for the top cabinet on your CNC, or you can print out the pieces at full-scale and follow along the outline with a jigsaw.

The following [SVG template](/hardware/arcade-cabinets/control-panel.svg) provides the outline for the cuts in the control panel that allow you to add the two-player buttons and joysticks.

## Kiosk Top Instructions


* Cut your cabinet pieces from plywood as indicated in the [SVG file](/hardware/arcade-cabinets/control-panel.svg).

* Cut the control panel from the second [Control panel image](/static/hardware/arcade-kiosks/control-panel-image.png).

* Cold-fit the pieces together using the tabs & notches to check for places that need to be sanded or filled.
* Take the control panel off again and add the buttons and joysticks according to the manufacturer's recommendations.

* Attach the speakers and monitors to their corresponding openings using screws. Make sure to arrange the cords and cables in a way that keeps them accessible once you attach your laptop.
* Reattach the control panel and secure with screws. Make sure the USB cable for the control board stays accessible for the laptop once everything is in place.
* Navigate to [arcade.makecode.com/kiosk](https://arcade.makecode.com/--kiosk) on the machine's laptop, then test-fit the laptop inside of the cabinet, making sure to connect all necessary cables. 
* Test the kiosk by attempting to select and play one of the two-player games. You should check that the joysticks move the players in the correct direction and that the buttons control the corresponding actions on MakeCode Arcade. 
* Once everything is working as expected, you should have a tabeltop kiosk that's ready to play!

## Kiosk Base Instructions

If you want a wooden stand for the cabinet, here are the plans for creating a base from the remaining plywood. 

![Kiosk Base](/static/hardware/arcade-kiosks/base-mockup.png)<br/>


* Mark your remaining sheet of plywood in such a way that you can cut four rectangles. 
 * For a base that sits flush with the cabinet, you'll need 2 sheets of 27"x34" and 2 of 18"x34".
 * For a base that sits inside the cabinet, use 2 sheets of 16"x34" and 2 of 17"x34".
 * (or measure the points on your cabinet where you want your base to rest and cut accordingly).

![Kiosk Base](/static/hardware/arcade-kiosks/base-outline.png)<br/>

* Clamp the four panels together into a box with no top or bottom. Test the fit before gluing and adding screws. 

_Note: Be sure to secure the top to the bottom with screws (even if temporarily) to keep students from knocking the top from the arcade during a heated game!_




## Decoration

This is your cabinet, have fun decorating it and personalize it the way you like! We have used
[Arcade Stencilr](https://riknoll.github.io/arcade-stenciler/) to generate stencils and drawing for cabinets in the past, but feel free to paint freehand in any way that represents your project.
