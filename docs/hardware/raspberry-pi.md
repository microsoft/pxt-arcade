# Raspberry Pi

Build full size MakeCode Arcade cabinets and kiosks using a Raspberry Pi Zero. 

* Kiosk mode operation: no internet, no operating system, just games.
* Hold plenty of games (thousands?)
* Drag and drop UF2 files into the pi just like the other boards.
* Use off-the-shelve Arcade buttons and joysticks for an authentic feeling
