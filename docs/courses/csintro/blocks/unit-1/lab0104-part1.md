# Part 1: A screen full of food
### @explicitHints true

## A screen full of food! @showdialog

In this lab, we will write a game where the player must eat all the food
which appearsâ€”while avoiding an enemy which bounces around the screen!

## Sprite-o-rama!

First, let's add a sprite to the screen every three seconds (or 3000 milliseconds).

~hint What is a millisecond?

---

A millisecond is 1/1000 of a second. In other words, 1,000 milliseconds
is the same as 1 second.

So, 3,000 milliseconds is the same as 3 seconds.
hint~

---

1.   From the **Game** drawer, add an <br/>
``||game:on game update every (500) ms||``<br/>
block to your project. Place it anywhere on your workspace.
1.   Change the time from 500 milliseconds to **3000** milliseconds.<br/>
(You will need to type the number, since 3 seconds isn't in the list.)
1.   From the **Sprites** drawer, add a   
``||variables(sprites):set [mySprite] to sprite [ ] of kind [Player]||``   
block to the   
``||game(noclick):on game update||``   
block that you just added to your workspace.
1.   This sprite represents food, so change the sprite kind to **Food**.
1.   Select or create any food image that you like for your sprite.
1.   Give the sprite variable a meaningful name, like `foodSprite`.

---

Watch your game run in the simulator. 

- What should be happening? 
- What appears to be happening?



#### ~ tutorialhint

```blocks
let foodSprite: Sprite = null
game.onUpdateInterval(3000, () => {
    foodSprite = sprites.create(sprites.food.smallApple, SpriteKind.Food)
})
```

## Go your own way, food!

It might look like you only have one sprite on your screen, but it only *looks* that way because the sprites are on top of each other!

Let's put them at random locations on the screen.

ðŸ’¡ _Don't forget to use the hint button at the bottom of the screen if you want to
see the code that you are trying to build in these steps._ 

---

1.   Add a   
``||sprites:set [mySprite] position to x [0] y [0]||`` <br/>
block to the **bottom** of  <br/>
``||game(noclick):on game update every (3000) ms||``. <br/>
1.   Select the dropdown next to the variable name and select the
variable that you created earlier.
1.   Instead of entering a number for the **x** and **y** coordinates,
we are going to use a block that picks a random number.
1.   From the **Math** drawer, drag a <br/>
``||math:pick random (0) to (10)||`` <br/>
block and drop it into the **x** value of the  <br/>
``||sprites(noclick):set [foodSprite] position to x [0] y [0]||`` <br/>
block.
1.   Instead of the numbers **0** and **10** for x, pick
a random number from **8** to **152**.

Let your program run in the simulator. That's a little better, right?
Now, let's pick a random **y** value, too.

1.   Drag another <br/>
``||math:pick random (0) to (10)||``<br/>
block and drop it into the **y** value of the <br/>
``||sprites(noclick):set [foodSprite] position to x [0] y [0]||`` <br/>
block.
1.   Change the random values to include numbers from **8** to **112**.

Now, you should have food appearing all over the screen!

---

**Questions**

-   Why might we use **8** to **152** for **x**?
-   Why might we use **8** to **112** for **y**?


#### ~ tutorialhint

```blocks
let foodSprite: Sprite = null
game.onUpdateInterval(3000, () => {
    foodSprite = sprites.create(sprites.food.smallApple, SpriteKind.Food)
    foodSprite.setPosition(randint(8, 152), randint(8, 112))
})
```

## Complete

Good work! Now, onward to Part 2 where we'll add a player sprite!



```ghost
let foodSprite: Sprite = null
game.onUpdateInterval(3000, function () {
    foodSprite = sprites.create(sprites.food.smallApple, SpriteKind.Food)
    foodSprite.setPosition(randint(8, 152), randint(8, 112))
})
```
