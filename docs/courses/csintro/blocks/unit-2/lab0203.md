# Lab 2.3: Variables and Math
### @explicitHints true

## Variables and math! @showdialog

Variables are really helpful, 
since they let us store information we want to use in our program.

Variables become even more powerful when we combine them!

In this lab, you'll discover different ways to do math with variables.

## Ooh! A playground!

Time for a coding playground.

---


Add blocks to your <br/>
``||loops(noclick):on start||`` <br/>
container that:

-    Ask the player for numbers two times
-    Store those numbers in two different variables

---


View the hint to check your code.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```blocks
let number1 = game.askForNumber("First number?")
let number2 = game.askForNumber("Second number?")
```

## Sum? Product? What's the difference?

Let's use the two numbers collected from the player.

---


Add blocks to your <br/>
``||loops(noclick):on start||`` <br/>
container so that your project shows the *sum* of the two numbers.


~hint What is a sum? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

---

The sum is the result of two numbers added together. In other words,
use the addition (or "plus") operator from the ``||math:Math||`` drawer to get the sum.

---


Run your project to test that it works. Try lots of different numbers!


#### ~ tutorialhint

```blocks
let number1 = game.askForNumber("First number?")
let number2 = game.askForNumber("Second number?")
game.splash("" + number1 + " + " + number2 + " = " + (number1 + number2))
```

## It's all in the numbers

Let's learn about some of the other blocks in the ``||math:Math||`` drawer!

---

-    Start with the block that you already have in your project.
Notice that the "plus sign" can be changed to different symbols.
-    For each of these operations, run your project a few times.
     -    Enter some numbers. (Try small ones at first.)
     -    Make a record of each of your trials.
          (In other words, write down the numbers that you enter...and the result...each time
          you run your program.)
     -    See if you can figure out what each operation does.
-    Once you have explored all of the operators in this first math block,
experiment with the remaining blocks in the
``||math:Math||``
drawer in the same way.
     -    You may not understand all of the operators that you find. That's OK!
     -    Be sure to write down all of your trials to show the work you have done.

---

Your instructor may give you a worksheet that you can use to write down
your trials and your explanations. If not, use any method that you like
to record your trials and your results.

Have fun!


## Complete

**Great work!**

Make sure to turn in your lab if your instructor has asked you to do so.



```ghost
let number1 = game.askForNumber("First number?")
let number2 = game.askForNumber("Second number?")
game.splash("" + number1 + " + " + number2 + " = " + (number1 + number2))
let number3 = Math.sqrt(number1)
number3 = 0 % 1
number3 = Math.min(0, number1)
number3 = Math.abs(number1)
number3 = Math.round(number1)
number3 = Math.constrain(0, 0, 0)
number3 = Math.map(0, 0, 1023, 0, 4)
