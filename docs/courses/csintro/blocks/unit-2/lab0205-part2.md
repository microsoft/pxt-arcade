# Lab 2.5 Part 2: Can You Even?
### @explicitHints true

## Is it even? @showdialog

Many programs need to test whether a number is even or odd. 

Let's write a tool for that!

![Lab 2.5.2](https://arcade.makecode.com/api/_bFJerdL13K0e/thumb)


## Collecting the evidence

First, let's get a number to test from the player.

---


1.   Create a variable that will store the player's number.
1.   To your ``||loops(noclick):on start||``
container, add blocks that ask the player for a number.
(Store the response in your new variable.)

---


Run your project to test your code. You can also check the hint.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```blocks
let theNumber = game.askForNumber("Enter a number.")
```

## Is it even or not?

Now, let's display a message to say whether the number is even.

You guessed it: We need to write another conditional statement!

---


1.   To the **bottom** of your <br/>
``||loops(noclick):on start||`` <br/>
container, add an <br/>
``||logic:if (true) then [] else []||`` <br/>
block.
1.   Use blocks from the <br/>
``||variables:Variables||``, <br/>
``||logic:Logic||``, and  <br/>
``||math:Math||``  <br/>
drawers to make the block say the following: <br/>
``||logic(noclick):if||`` ``||math(noclick):remainder of||``
``||variables(noclick):(your variable)||`` ``||math(noclick):/ (2)||``
``||logic(noclick):= (0) then||``.
1.  In each half of the ``||logic(noclick):if||`` container,
add blocks to display an appropriate message.

~hint How do I know if the number is even?

---

If the number is even then, when you divide it by two, the remainder is zero.

Run your project to test your code. Check the hint if you get stuck.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```blocks
let theNumber = game.askForNumber("Enter a number.")
if (theNumber % 2 == 0) {
    game.splash("" + theNumber + " is even!")
} else {
    game.splash("" + theNumber + " is not even.")
}
```

## Complete @showdialog

**Good work!**

Let's make a fortune telling device in Part 3!

```ghost
let theNumber = game.askForNumber("Enter a number.")
if (theNumber % 2 == 0) {
    game.splash("" + theNumber + " is even!")
} else {
    game.splash("" + theNumber + " is not even.")
}
```
