# Lab 3.1 Part 1: Repeat That, Please
### @explicitHints true

## Repeat that, please! @showdialog

In this lab, we will explore a family of loops called *definite loops*.

*Definite loops* are loops that run a specific number of times.

In Part 1, we'll use one of those loops: the **repeat** loop.


```block
let foodSprite: Sprite = null
for (let index = 0; index < 6; index++) {
    foodSprite = sprites.create(sprites.food.smallApple, SpriteKind.Player)
    foodSprite.setPosition(randint(8, 152), randint(8, 112))
}
```

## Take an apple; leave an apple

Let's create a hero sprite and drop food randomly on the screen.

---

1.  Create a sprite for your hero character
    -   Give the sprite's variable an appropriate name
    -    Give the sprite an image
1.  Allow the player to move the hero sprite around the screen
1.  Whenever the player presses **A**, add a new sprite to the screen
    -   Give the new sprite's variable an appropriate name
    -   Give the sprite an image
    -   Place the sprite at a random location on the screen

---


Run your project and verify that it works as described.

```blocks
controller.A.onEvent(ControllerButtonEvent.Pressed, function () {
    foodSprite = sprites.create(sprites.food.smallApple, SpriteKind.Player)
    foodSprite.setPosition(randint(8, 152), randint(8, 112))
})
let foodSprite: Sprite = null
let heroSprite = sprites.create(sprites.castle.princess2Right1, SpriteKind.Player)
controller.moveSprite(heroSprite)
```

## Drop two!

Instead of dropping just one piece of fruit (or other food), let's say we
wanted to drop two pieces of food. That's easy enough to do: just duplicate
the blocks that we have.

But what if we wanted to drop three? Or five?
Or ten? Or what if you wanted to change the number of sprites dropped throughout
the game?

There is a better way to do this: Use a **repeat** loop.

~hint What is a Repeat Loop? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

---

In MakeCode Arcade, we call this a **repeat loop**:

```block
for (let index = 0; index < 4; index++) { }
```

This loop allows you to tell the computer how many times you want the code inside to run, then it will repeat the code that many times before moving on.

_Note: The repeat will only include the code **inside** the container. 
It will keep looping through that code until it has run the number of times that you 
asked it to, and once it's done it will immediately continue running the rest of your program._

1.    From the 
``||loops:Loops||`` drawer, drop a  <br/>
``||loops:repeat (4) times||`` <br/>
loop into **the top** of your <br/>
``||controller(noclick): on (A) button (pressed)||`` <br/>
container
1.    Move the existing blocks from that container **into** the
``||loops(noclick):repeat||`` loop
1.    Change the number of repeats to **2**

---

Run your project and verify that the player drops **two** pieces of food
each time you press **A**.

Check the hint if you need help.

```blocks
controller.A.onEvent(ControllerButtonEvent.Pressed, function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        foodSprite = sprites.create(sprites.food.smallApple, SpriteKind.Player)
        foodSprite.setPosition(randint(8, 152), randint(8, 112))
    }
})
let foodSprite: Sprite = null
```

## Kick the tires!

Experiment with your new loop! As you try different **repeat** values,
answer the questions below.

---


**Questions**

-    Are there any numbers that are **not** allowed to be a repeat value?
-    Are there any numbers that work in unexpected ways?
-    How might you use a **repeat** block in your own projects?

## Food fight!

Instead of dropping food at random locations, let's make it look like the hero is throwing it!

---


1.  **Delete** all of the blocks inside of the ``||loops(noclick):repeat||`` container.
Keep the loop, though!
1.  Add the following blocks to your ``||loops(noclick):repeat||`` loop:
    1.   Create a variable called **speedX**
        1.   Initialize **speedX** to a random value between 10 and 40
    1.   Create another variable called **speedY**
        1.   Set **speedY** so that it reads:<br/>
        ``||variables:set [speedY] to [50 - speedX]||``
    1.   Create a projectile that starts from your hero sprite with velocities of
    **speedX** and **speedY** (for x and y respectively)

These blocks will send the projectiles in random(ish) directions, but will
keep their speeds roughly the same.


~hint A Different Projectile üöÄ

---

In previous projects, we created projectiles as if they were normal sprites, 
then we added extra blocks to set starting positions and velocity. 

This time, we want to use the built-in ``||variables(sprites): set [projectile]||`` block
to create the projectile, and have it do all the rest for us!

```block

        let speedX = 0
        let speedY = 0
        let foodSprite: Sprite = sprites.createProjectileFromSprite(sprites.food.smallApple, heroSprite, speedX, speedY)
```

Run your project and see how it operates now.
Try different values for the repeat!

How might you use this in your own projects?

Check the hint if you need any help.

#### ~ tutorialhint

```block
controller.A.onEvent(ControllerButtonEvent.Pressed, function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        let speedX = randint(10, 40)
        let speedY = 50 - speedX
        let foodSprite: Sprite = sprites.createProjectileFromSprite(sprites.food.smallApple, heroSprite, speedX, speedY)
    }
})
```

## Complete! @showdialog

**Good work!** <br/>
üëèüèΩ üëèüèΩ üëèüèΩ

You have successfully used the **repeat** loop!

Try these extensions if you have time:

-    Can you generate a random number of projectiles with each button press?
-    Because both speed values are positive, the projectiles always move
toward the bottom-right corner of the screen. Can you find a way to make
the directions more random?
-    Instead of sending the projectiles in random directions, can you
distribute them more uniformly around the hero?

```ghost
controller.A.onEvent(ControllerButtonEvent.Pressed, function () {
    for (let index = 0; index < 2; index++) {
        foodSprite = sprites.create(sprites.food.smallApple, SpriteKind.Player)
        foodSprite.setPosition(randint(8, 152), randint(8, 112))
        speedX = randint(10, 40)
        speedY = 50 - speedX
        foodSprite = sprites.createProjectileFromSprite(sprites.food.smallApple, heroSprite, speedX, speedY)
    }
})
let speedY = 0
let speedX = 0
let heroSprite: Sprite = null
heroSprite = sprites.create(sprites.food.smallTaco, SpriteKind.Player)
controller.moveSprite(heroSprite)
```
