# Create or Edit Your Own MakeCode Skillmaps 

Did you know you can create your own MakeCode tutorials? 

You can also create or edit MakeCode skillmaps to better reflect your classroom interests. 

This 3 part series will show you how. 

## Introduction

[**Tutorials**](https://makecode.com/writing-docs/tutorials) are created using [markdown text](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) and custom instructions to provide the experience you're trying to achieve. 

[**Skillmaps**](https://makecode.com/writing-docs/skillmaps) are also the result of a markdown file, but this one sews multiple tutorials together into a custom pathway that guides users from one experience to another. 

Small sections of tutorials can be edited very easily using our [Tutorial Tool](https://makecode.com/tutorial-tool) located at [https://makecode.com/tutorial-tool](https://makecode.com/tutorial-tool).  Those edited tutorials can be shared by clicking the share button in the upper-right corner.
