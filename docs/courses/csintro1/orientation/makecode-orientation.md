# Activity: Getting Started with MakeCode Arcade

This activity starts with the basics needed to get started in MakeCode Arcade.

The MakeCode Arcade platform is similar to other MakeCode products featuring Minecraft, micro:bit, and [more](https://makecode.com). Previous users of MakeCode (or other block based coding platforms) will see familiar blocks and features . If you are new to MakeCode, welcome! 

MakeCode Arcade uses general game concepts such as ``||sprites:Sprites||``, ``||scene:Scene||``, and ``||controller:Controller||`` to make writing arcade games easier, as well as categories of blocks that are common to other MakeCode Products such as ``||loops:Loops||``, ``||logic:Logic||``, ``||variables:Variables||``, and ``||math:Math||``. As soon as you add in your first block, you can start to run your code in seconds using the in-browser simulator, with your games changing with every new block you add.

In this activity, students are introduced to:
* Opening a game, game controls, and playing a game
* Creating a new game
* The difference between blocks and script
* "My Projects"
* Sharing games by downloading, and creating a game link


## Concept: Opening a game

## Student Task #1: Playing Space Destroyer
1. Click the "Space Destroyer" example game under the "Blocks Games" category
2. Select "Open Example"
3. Press left and right on the direction pad to move the space ship, and press the a to fire the laser
4. Pay careful attention to what happens when the laser collides with an asteroid

### New Project

## Student Task #2: Starting your own game
1. Press the "Home" button in the upper left corner to return to the homepage
2. Press the "New Project" button 
3. The screen will start with two blocks by default - we will focus on the ``||loops:on start||`` block for now, so drag the ``||game:on game update||`` block to the side bar to delete it as shown below

4. Drag out a new sprite and have it ``||sprite:say||`` something as shown below

5. At the bottom of the screen, select a name to save this game as (e.g. - "first game"), and click "Download" to download it.

6. Students will turn in this file today, so be sure to keep track of it!

## Student Task #3: Importing your game
To make sure you saved your project properly, we should import it back into MakeCode Arcade!
1. Press the "Home" button in the upper left corner to return to the homepage
2. The "My Projects" section should now include the game you created in the last task. To the right of it, there should be a button labeled "Import" - press that button
3. Select "Import File..."
4. Select the file you saved in task #2
5. Your code should now appear in the browser window

Alternatively, you can simply drag the image that you downloaded onto the home page and it will load automatically.

## Student Task #4: Sharing your game
There is one other common way that we will keep track of our games: by making links to directly access the code.
1. Press the "Home" button in the upper left corner to return to the homepage
2. Select your game from task #2 under "My Projects"
3. Select the share button in the upper left corner, as shown below. Verify that you want to publish the code, and keep track of the URL it shows - that is a link directly to your code!

## What did we learn?
1. What did the ``||sprite:say||`` block do when you added it to the game in task #2? 
2. Compare and contrast the two different ways that we saved our game; what are the benefits of each choice? Which do you think you would use if you wanted to email a game you made to your friend, and why would you make that decision?
3. Include the image created in task #2.
4. Include the link created in task #4.

## Rubrics

### ~hint

Start on the left rubric column (5pts), if the work meets the rubric measurement continue to the right (7pts, 9pts, 10pts). Award the score of the right most rubric that is passed.  This means that to get the highest score student must pass all previous rubrics.

### Tasks rubric
| points | 5 | 7 | 9 | 10 |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Orientation | Task #1 moved ship and scored a point | Task #2 made a sprite say | Task #3 opened game .gif file | Shared a link to a game |

### Score = \_\_\_\_\_\_ /10 

### What did we learn rubric

|   | 5pts | 7pts | 9pts | 10pts |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Explanation | Student answered #1 & #2  | Clear explanation of using ``||sprite:say||`` | clear explanation of email game choice (file or link) |  Explanations use an creative example or analogy |

### Score = \_\_\_\_\_\_ /10
