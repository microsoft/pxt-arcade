# Edit a MakeCode Tutorial 

It's pretty easy to take a MakeCode tutorial and make it your own!  The basic steps are as follows:

1) Copy the markdown from a [MakeCode tutorial](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-arcade/tree/master/docs/tutorials)<br/>
2) Edit the items you want to change in the [Tutorial Tool](https://makecode.com/tutorial-tool)<br/>
3) Distribute your new version using the [Share Button](/static/courses/tutorial-tutorial/share-tut.png)<br/>

Let's do an example together.

### Step 1. Find the tutorial that you want to edit

You can find MakeCode tutorials at [https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-arcade/tree/master/docs/tutorials](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-arcade/tree/master/docs/tutorials).

For this example, we'll use [hundred.md](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-arcade/blob/master/docs/tutorials/hundred.md)

You will need to copy the text from the "Raw" version of the file, then paste it into the [Tutorial Tool](https://makecode.com/tutorial-tool).

#### Note:

This example uses only a single tutorial.  If you want to learn more about multi-tutorial sequences (called skillmaps) you can [try this exercise instead](/courses/tut-tut/make-smap).

### Step 2. Make your changes in the Tutorial Tool 


Open the Tutorial Tool at [https://makecode.com/tutorial-tool](https://makecode.com/tutorial-tool) and paste the copied code inside the editor. 

Since we're working with Arcade here, we'll choose the Arcade emulator from the dropdown. We also have emulators for micro:bit, Minecraft, and Circuit Playground. 

Then we click "Run".

<br/>

To customize this tutorial, we'll change 100 to 50 throughought the whole document using find/replace. Click "Run" again to see the updates.
