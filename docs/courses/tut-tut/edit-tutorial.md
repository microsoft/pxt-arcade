# Edit a MakeCode Tutorial 

It's pretty easy to take a MakeCode tutorial and make it your own!  The basic steps are as follows:

- Copy the markdown from a [MakeCode tutorial](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-arcade/tree/master/docs/tutorials)<br/>
- Edit the items you want to change in the [Tutorial Tool](https://makecode.com/tutorial-tool)<br/>
- Distribute your new version using the [Share Button](/static/courses/tutorial-tutorial/share-tut.png)<br/>

Let's do an example together.

### Step 1. Find the tutorial that you want to edit

You can find MakeCode tutorials at [https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-arcade/tree/master/docs/tutorials](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-arcade/tree/master/docs/tutorials).

For this example, we'll use [hundred.md](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-arcade/blob/master/docs/tutorials/hundred.md)

You will need to copy the text from the "Raw" version of the file, then paste it into the [Tutorial Tool](https://makecode.com/tutorial-tool).

#### Note:

This example uses only a single tutorial.  If you want to learn more about multi-tutorial sequences (called skillmaps) you can [try this exercise instead](/courses/tut-tut/make-smap).

### Step 2. Review the Current Markdown 


Open the Tutorial Tool at [https://makecode.com/tutorial-tool](https://makecode.com/tutorial-tool) and paste the copied code into the editor. 

Since we're working with Arcade here, we'll choose the Arcade emulator from the dropdown. We also have emulators for micro:bit, Minecraft, and Circuit Playground. 

Click "Run".

<br/>

You should see the opening **modal** (pop-up window) in the viewer on the right-hand side. Review the text in that window, then find the text in the left-hand pane that corresponds to it.  That's where the tutorial starts.  Everything above that point is hidden from display.

Notice that there is a lot of *green* text in the tutorial tool. Those are comments that I've added to explain each of the elements of our tutorial markdown. You **do not** need to keep these in your final tutorials, but if you find them to be helpful, it's fine to leave them.

### Step 3. Make changes in the Tutorial Tool 


To customize this tutorial, we'll start by changing **100** to **50** throughought the whole document using **find/replace**. Click "Run" again to see the updates.

Next, we'll add a step.
