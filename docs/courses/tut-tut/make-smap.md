# Create a MakeCode Skillmap 

It's pretty easy to take a MakeCode tutorial and make it your own!  The basic steps are as follows:

- Copy the markdown from a [MakeCode tutorial](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-arcade/tree/master/docs/tutorials)
- Edit the items you want to change in the [Tutorial Tool](https://makecode.com/tutorial-tool) 
- Distribute your new version using the [Share Button](/static/courses/tutorial-tutorial/share-tut.png) 


## Follow Along

Let's do an example together. 

### Step 1. Find the tutorial that you want to edit

You can find MakeCode tutorials at [https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-arcade/tree/master/docs/tutorials](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-arcade/tree/master/docs/tutorials).

For this example, we'll use [hundred.md](https://github.com/microsoft/pxt-arcade/blob/master/docs/tutorials/hundred.md)

#### Note:

This example uses only a single tutorial.  If you want to learn more about multi-tutorial sequences (called skillmaps) you can try this exercise instead.
