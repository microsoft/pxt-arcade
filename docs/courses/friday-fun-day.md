# Friday Fun Day Activities

These activities are meant to be experienced with very little preparation. Tutorials guide students through step-by-step, making for a low-effort solution around holidays,
reward days, or even days requiring unplanned substitutes. 


## Activity 1: Code an Arcade Carnival Game
Choose one of the options below to get started with your online carnival game!

```codecard
[
{
  "name": "Whack the Mole",
  "cardType": "link",
  "description": "Create your own mole whacking carnival game.",
  "imageUrl": "/static/skillmap/backgrounds/mole.gif",
  "url": "https://arcade.makecode.com/--skillmap#mole",
  "directOpen": true
}, {
  "name": "Burstin' Balloons",
  "cardType": "link",
  "description": "Create a simple carnival game where you click quickly to try to burst a balloon before time runs out.",
  "imageUrl": "/static/skillmap/backgrounds/mouse.gif",
  "url": "https://arcade.makecode.com/--skillmap#balloon",
  "directOpen": true
}, {
  "name": "Target Practice",
  "description": "Follow a video to learn how to launch a ball at moving targets",
  "url": "https://arcade.makecode.com/#tutorial:/tutorials/target",
  "cardType": "tutorial",
  "imageUrl": "/static/skillmap/backgrounds/target-comp.gif",
  "largeImageUrl": "/static/skillmap/backgrounds/target-comp.gif",
  "label": "Video tutorial",
  "labelClass": "ribbon"
}
]
```



## Activity 2: Low-Code Activities
These activities are code-adjacent, but don't require as large of a lift. 

```codecard
[
{
  "name": "Word Search",
  "description": "Complete the word search, then do a scavenger hunt in Arcade to answer some thought exercises.",
  "url": "https://1drv.ms/b/s!AqsgsTyHBmRBnVSIXNe22i0bwfap?e=3vxNKn",
  "imageUrl": "/static/courses/carnival/projectPlanning.png"
},
{
  "name": "Asphodel",
  "description": "Asphodel follows directions. Can you?",
  "url": "https://arcade.makecode.com/74836-65792-71541-17446",
  "imageUrl": "https://arcade.makecode.com/api/74836-65792-71541-17446/thumb"
}
]
```




## Activity 3: Friday Fun Day Packages
These are intended to be complete packages that can be picked up and run without any pre-planning!


```codecard
[

{
  "name": "Cryptic Coordinates",
  "description": "Your students have been given a secret assignment. Can they save Agent Whiskers?",
  "url": "https://aka.ms/decrypt",
  "imageUrl": "https://makecode.com/api/_EbdVzJJPa7m0/thumb"
}
]
```
