# Programming Language

In this course, we commonly refer to the language being used as JavaScript,
but this is a slight misnomer.
The language we use has significant similarities to JavaScript,
but there are a few differences to ease students into programming as a whole,
rather than focusing solely on JavaScript.
For more information on the language used in MakeCode,
see the [Programming Language Documentation](https://www.makecode.com/language).
