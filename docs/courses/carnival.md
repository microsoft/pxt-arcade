Give your students a lesson they'll never forget with this Code a Carnival series!

Start by coding simple online midway-style carnival games using our easy to follow interface from Microsoft MakeCode Arcade. Next, move on full STEAM as you construct actual midway games from household materials.  Finally, add physical computing into the mix by connecting micro:bit controllers to your creations as a way of keeping score or indicating a win or loss!

Explore as little or as much as you want with this modularized series of lessons. Everything you need is included...even the slides and worksheets!
