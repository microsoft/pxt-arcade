The MakeCode editor is available as app which you can install on a computer with Windows or Mac OS. Once installed, the **[MakeCode Offline App](/offline-app)** lets you create, run, and download your projects to the @boardname@. It works the same as the Web application does in your browser but it's a stand-alone application that will work when a connection to the internet is restricted or not available.
