The MakeCode @boardname@ editor is available as an app which you can install on a Windows or Mac OS Computer. Once installed, the **[MakeCode Offline App](/offline-app)** lets you create, run, and download your projects to your device. It works the same as the Web application does in your browser, but it's a stand-alone application that will work when a connection to the internet is restricted or not available.
