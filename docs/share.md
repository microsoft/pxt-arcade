## Editing Shared Projects #editing

By default, all shared projects in MakeCode can be copied and edited.  There is no way to share a read-only project or a project where people can’t make a copy or can’t see the code. When a user opens a project from a Share Link (either anonymous or persistent), they will see the game window. They may also click the buttons on the top left of the screen to see the code or make a copy of the project and edit it. Any edits they make will not change the original project - if they want to share their changes back, they will have to create a new share link.
