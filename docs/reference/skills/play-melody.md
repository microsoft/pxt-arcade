## Add a Melody

Put a little song in your project!

For a multi-note melody, add the **play melody** block where you want to launch the music.

### Example Code

```block
music.playMelody("" + "C D E F G A B C5 " + "C5 B A G F E D C ", 120)
```

### Use a Melody from the Gallery

The music gallery has a handful of songs for various occasions.  Click on the musical note and choose *Gallery** to scroll through them.

### Create a Melody

Have a song in your heart that you want to share? Click the music note on the **play melody** block to open the music editor. 

Here, each row is a tone on the scale (C, D, E, F, G, ,A, B, C5) from bottom to top.  Each column is a beat.  You can stitch multiple measures togther using the ``||text: join [ ] [ ]||`` block in the ``||text:Text||`` category.
