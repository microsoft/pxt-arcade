# Tutorial Bundles

## About Tutorial Bundles

The **Bundles** blocks you see in this tutorial are special organizational blocks designed specifically for this tutorial. They help group related code together to make it easier to follow the tutorial steps.

## What do they do?

These bundle blocks simply run the code inside them - they don't add any special functionality. Think of them as helpful containers that:

- Keep related code organized
- Make tutorial steps clearer
- Show you which pieces of code work together

## How to use them

Just follow the tutorial instructions! As you progress through the tutorial, you'll see how each bundle block is used and what it contains. The blocks help you:

1. **Understand the structure** - Each bundle focuses on one part of your game
2. **Stay organized** - Related code stays together
3. **Build step-by-step** - Complete one bundle at a time
