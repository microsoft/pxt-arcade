# MakeCode @boardname@ Tour

The MakeCode @boardname@ editor is a full-featured coding platform for creating games using Blocks, JavaScript, and Python. It includes both Blocks, JavaScript, and Python editors with access to code elements to build any console style game you can think of. The editor is comes with a game simulator to test, play, and debug the game code you create.

Along with the editor, there are resources on the [Home Page](@homeurl@) to create projects, try tutorials, explore examples, do lessons, and more!

## Home Page

The **Home Page** is where you begin your game coding experience. It offers selections to work on a project, try a tutorial, explore some examples, start a coding lesson, or watch an informative video.

In the **Editor** you create your Blocks, JavaScript, or Python code. There's a Toolbox with the code functions and methods to use for building your game. You can save and share projects, and even put them on GitHub. There's a complete game simulator so you can try your game at any time while you build it.
