# Code Evaluation Tool

## Overview

The [Code Evaluation Tool]( https://arcade.makecode.com/--eval) is a mechanism for constructing a checklist of requirements for an assignment and running that list automatically against projects in quick succession. This allows teachers to build a checklist, then easily evaluate any number of projects based on that checklist. Projects are evaluated one at a time, but with auto-run enabled, you can update the loaded project by providing a new share link, at which point the rules will automatically be re-run on the new project.
