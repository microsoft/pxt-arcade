**Welcome to the 9th Official Microsoft MakeCode Game Jam!**

This is a fun competition where you can pit your game development skills against others to build a game using [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com), a game engine for retro pixel-art games that run in the browser or on handheld game devices.


## Theme

The theme of this jam is...

**_Superheroes for My Community_**

For this jam, create games that reflect characters who YOU see as superheroes.  They can be real or fictional, human or non-human...but whatever you create, make sure that it reflects the needs of you and your community.
