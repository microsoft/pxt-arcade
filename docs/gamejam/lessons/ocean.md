# Game Jam in a Box

![MakeCode Arcade Ocean Jam](/static/gamejam/jams/ocean/assets/preview.png)

A game jam is a hackathon for building games! The "official" [MakeCode Arcade Ocean Jam](https://arcade.makecode.com/gamejam/ocean) runs from Nov 30, 2020 to Dec 11, 2020, but the game jam is really just a concentrated period of time for students to make games around a theme, so it can be run in any classroom, for any length of time--from an hour, to several weeks!

## Rules

The rules are lightweight and can be adjusted as necessary:
1.  Your game must relate to the jam theme. Someone playing your game should be able to see how it relates to the theme without extra explanation.
2.  Be creative!

## Examples

The theme for this game jam is **Ocean**. This could be games about swimming, or beaches, or marine life. Some real life examples of "ocean-themed" games might be Ecco the Dolphin, Sea of Thieves, or Subnautica. Students should feel free to interpret the theme creatively! Some other game concepts that fit the theme include:
-  Exploring the sea to find shipwrecks
-  Doing surfing stunts to impress a panel of judges
-  A lighthouse guiding ships to shore

## Starter Game

Some students may immediately have ideas for the game they want to make. If students are stuck, however, we've also provided a [basic starter game](https://makecode.com/_E9tT2HVaqVMM) that someone could build off of:

This is a very simple game where the player must eat smaller fish and avoid bigger fish. The code is commented to explain what each block does. Some suggestions for starting directions are:

### Improve the story

- The art for this game isn't great. Can you improve it? Try to tell a story--you might be a submarine, avoiding torpedoes and collecting research samples, or a mermaid, dodging sharks and picking up treasure. You could even add a background image to fill out the world.
- Add some effects! Check out the ``||sprites:mySprite start effects||``  and ``||scene:start screen effect||``  blocks to add bubbles or flames to your characters.
- Animate the art. Click on **Advanced** and then **Extensions** in the toolbox, then select the Animation extension to add blocks that will allow you to animate.
- **CHALLENGE:** Make the player grow bigger when you eat a small fish. Check out the ``||sprites:set mySprite image to||`` block!

### Make the game more fun

- Add a powerup to the game! First brainstorm some possible powerups for this game: is it something that makes you move faster or the enemies slower? Maybe you could make all the enemies tiny or make yourself very large.
- Add projectiles to defend yourself! Can you make the fish shoot bubbles when you press the **A** button?
- Add different enemy or food types. Start by adding different images--enemies could be sharks, or eels, or driftwood. Then think about different behavior for the sprites--could enemies or food come from the top or bottom of the screen?
- **CHALLENGE:** Check out the **Status bar** extension. Can you add a hunger bar to the player that goes down over time?

### Hack the game

You have access to all the code in this game! Can you hack it to make it easier for you, or super hard for your friends? What if you added extra lives, or gave yourself more points when the food is eaten? Can you add superspeed, or make the enemies very very slow? What other cool hacks can you think of?
