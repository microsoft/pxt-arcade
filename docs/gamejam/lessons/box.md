# Game Jam in a Box

## What is a game jam?

A game jam is a friendly competition for participants to make and showcase games centered around a specific theme.  A game jam can be run in the classroom or as part of a coding camp as a fun challenge where individuals or teams can practice their game development skills.

The Game Jam in a Box resources are all you need to run a game jam yourself.

## Thinking about theme

Computer Science is helping to solve some of the toughest problems we’re facing in the world – like combating infectious diseases, reducing the effects of climate change, and distributing resources to those in need. This makes a game jam a perfect opportunity to apply computing skills to any topic – social good, local community cause, academic subject area, or physical/mental health issue.

## Timeframe

Game Jams typically run for a couple weeks. However, you can decide what timeframe works best for you.  A game jam can be for any length of time – from an hour, to several weeks!

## Rules

Below are some rules that have been used for game jams in the past. Determine the rules and rubric for your game jam.

- Games must be built using [MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/) (they can be written in Blocks or JavaScript/Python)
- Your game must relate to the jam theme. Someone playing your game should be able to see how it relates to the theme without explanation.
- Keep the games PG: no inappropriate, offensive, or excessively violent content
- Be creative and have fun!

## Submit

Decide how participants will submit their games to you.

- Submit a link – Students can click the share button at the top right of the MakeCode Arcade editor page, then select Publish project.  They can copy and paste the resulting link in an email or document.

| Share | Publish |
| -- | -- |

- Submit a file – Students can click the save button at the bottom of the MakeCode Arcade editor page to download a .png file of their project.  They can copy this file to a fileshare location or email it to you.  You can import this file (or just drag and drop it) into MakeCode Arcade.

## Celebrate

Will you just be awarding participation certificates or calling out specific projects for their creativity, complexity, or alignment with the assigned theme? Download, customize and award [certificates of achievement](https://aka.ms/GameJamBoxCert).
