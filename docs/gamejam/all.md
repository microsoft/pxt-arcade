# MakeCode Arcade Game Jam

A game jam is a friendly competition where participants are challenged to make a game centered around a specific theme within a certain amount of time. Game Jams are a great way to learn, express your creativity, connect and collaborate with others, and get recognition for bringing your amazing ideas to life!

You can host your own Game Jams using the materials from the [Game Jam in a Box](/gamejam/lessons/box) resources.

The MakeCode Team regularly hosts game jams â€“ keep an eye on the [MakeCode Forum](https://forum.makecode.com/c/share-your-arcade-projects-here/5) for the next game jam announcement. Check out some of the previous MakeCode hosted game jams below.
