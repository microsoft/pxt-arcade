Never has a game united the MakeCode team in such awe!  We laughed. We cried. We shook in fear. This is a fantastic example of what we hope [forum.makecode.com](https://forum.makecode.com) never becomes...but it was beyond fun to play through this simulation to figure out how many endings were possible. 



### Second Place: [Fighting Fire by Toolazyfurnames](https://arcade.makecode.com/S92945-87110-90152-31022)

With it's gorgeous graphics and rapid game play, this unique take on a Galga style game can entertain you for hours!

This platformer is nearly impossible for those who are inexperienced with keyboard navigation, but it presents a hearty challenge and tons of fun for those who persevere.
