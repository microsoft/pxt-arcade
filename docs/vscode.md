# Microsoft MakeCode Arcade extension for Visual Studio Code

A VS Code extension for making retro-style video games with [Microsoft MakeCode Arcade](https://arcade.makecode.com/). Code, create pixel art, design levels, and play your game in the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) app or at [vscode.dev](https://insiders.vscode.dev/makecode)!

## Install the MakeCode extension in VS Code

If you're using the VS Code app instead of vscode.dev, make sure the **Microsoft MakeCode Arcade** extension is installed. Check by going to the **View** menu and chose **Extensions** (View > Extenstions). If you don't see the extension in the installed list, search for it by typing "makecode" in the search box. When it appears in the results list, click the Install button.

## Starting a new project

To start a new MakeCode project in VS Code, you first need to open an empty folder (File > Open Folder). If you don't have an empty folder ready, go create one with your computer's file manager.

### ~ hint

#### File menu on **vscode.dev**

In vscode.dev, the **File** menu is located in the hamburger button (☰) in the top-left corner of the page.

### ~

Once you've opened a folder, you can create an empty project by clicking the "Create an empty project" command in the MakeCode Asset Explorer.

### Importing an existing MakeCode project

If you have a share link for a MakeCode Arcade project, you can also import it by clicking the "Import project from URL" command and pasting the URL in the input window that appears.

### Opening an existing GitHub project

If you have opened a GitHub repository that contains a MakeCode Arcade project, you'll need to install your project's dependencies for features like intellisense to work. Click the "Install project dependencies" command in the ACTIONS section of the MakeCode Asset Explorer to download and install them.

### ~ hint

#### Online dependencies

You must be connected to the internet in order to download and install MakeCode extensions needed by your projects.

## Anatomy of a MakeCode project

Inside your MakeCode project, you'll see a folder structure that looks something like this:

```
project/
├─ built/
├─ main.ts
└─ pxt.json
   ...
```

Don't worry if you don't see all of these files or if your project contains more than what's listed here! We're just going to go over the important ones first:

* `built/` - contains all of the compiled code for your project. If you compile your project, the result will show up inside this directory.
* `main.ts` - is the main code file for your project. This code will run when you run your game.
* `pxt.json` - is the file that configures your project. More on that below!

Some other files you might see in your project include:

* `*.jres` and `*.g.jres` - these files contain the assets for your project like images, animations, songs, and tilemaps. See "Managing your project's assets" below for more information on assets.
* `*.g.ts` - these files are autogenerated when the assets for your project change. Don't edit these by hand!
* `README.md` - this is a markdown file where you can add documentation for your project that other people can read when they import it.
* `main.blocks` - if you imported your project, it might have a blocks file inside. You can't edit this file inside of VS code!
* `tsconfig.json` - this file is required to make features like intellisense work in the editor. You probably don't need to edit it!
* `.github`, `mkc.json`, `.vscode`, `.gitignore`, `.prettierrc`, `assets.json` - These are all advanced configuration files. You can safely ignore them!

### Project settings - pxt.json

The `pxt.json` file is very important and it's required in all MakeCode projects. Be careful when editing this file! If contains invalid JSON or is missing required fields, your project might stop working. Always check for errors before saving it!

Some of the more important fields in this file are:

* **name** - name of the project. When you create a share link, this name is what people will see. Try to make it descriptive!
* **description** - description of your project.
* **dependencies** - this field contains all of the extensions used by your project. To add/remove an extension, see the sections below. By default, all arcade projects depend on the `device` extension; make sure not to remove it if you want your project to work with MakeCode Arcade!
* **files** - a list of the files in your project. All `.ts`, `.jres`, `.g.ts`, `.g.jres`, and `.md` files should be listed here.
* **palette (optional)** - this optional field can be used to change the 15 colors that MakeCode Arcade uses for its color palette. More information [here](https://arcade.makecode.com/developer/images).
* **version (optional)** - this optional field is used to set the version of your project. Versions should be in the from 0.0.0 (aka [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)). This field is mostly just for extensions.
* **testFiles (optional)** - this optional field lists files to include when building the project itself, but not include when the project is added to another project as an extension. It's useful for testing out your code if you are authoring an extension.

### Adding a file to your project

Whenever you create a new file that you want to be included in your project, you need to add it to the **files** entry inside `pxt.json`. If you aren't seeing your changes when you run your game, make sure you didn't leave a file out!

## Run your project in the simulator

Click the "Start MakeCode simulator" command in the MakeCode Asset Explorer to run your game inside of VS Code. A new view pane for the simulator will open after the project has finished compiling and will automatically reload whenever you save a file in the open workspace.

![Screenshot of VS Code with the MakeCode simulator open and the "Start MakeCode simulator" command highlighted](/static/vscode/simulator-pane.png)

To use your keyboard to control the simulator, make sure to click on the simulator pane first so that it has input focus.

### Viewing the simulator console

All serial messages and exceptions from the simulator are printed in VS Code's output view pane. If the output view pane is hidden, you can open it from the View menu in the top bar (View > Output).

### ~ hint

#### View menu on **vscode.dev**

In vscode.dev, the **View** menu is located in the hamburger button (☰) in the top-left corner of the page.

### ~

Once the pane is visible you can view all MakeCode messages by selecting "MakeCode" from the dropdown in the top-right:

## Managing your project assets

All of your projects images, tilemaps, animations, and songs will be listed inside the MakeCode Arcade Asset Explorer. Clicking on an asset from this list will open the asset editor. Any changes made to an asset inside of this editor will be automatically saved in your project.

### Creating an asset

To create a new asset, hover over the asset type in the MakeCode Asset Explorer and click the "Create File" icon that is shown:

![Screenshot of the MakeCode Asset Explorer with a red arrow pointing to the create icon in the images section](/static/vscode/create-new-asset.png)

### Editing assets

To edit an existing asset, click on its name in the asset explorer to open it in the asset editor. To rename an asset, change its name in the text input that appears in the bottom of the asset editor. If you don't see the text input, you may need to increase the width of the pane that the asset editor is in.

![Screenshot of VS Code with the asset editor open to a cat sprite and a red box around the asset name.](/static/vscode/asset-rename.png)

### Deleting and duplicating assets

When you hover over the name of an asset, two icons will appear next to it:

![Screenshot of the MakeCode Asset Explorer with a red square around two icons next to the name of an image asset](/static/vscode/duplicate-delete.png)

* Clicking on the **trash can** icon will delete the asset from your project. Be careful, there is no undo for this operation!
* Clicking the **copy** icon will duplicate the asset and open the copy in the asset editor.

### Referencing assets inside your code

To reference an asset you've created inside your code, you can use the name you gave it with one of the tagged templates in the `assets` namespace:

```typescript-ignore
let myImage = assets.image`imageName`;
let myAnimation = assets.animation`animName`;
let myTile = assets.tile`tileName`;
let myTilemap = assets.tilemap`tilemapName`;
let mySong = assets.song`songName`;
```

## Adding an extension to your project

To add a MakeCode extension to your project, click the "Add an extension" command in the ACTIONS section of the MakeCode Asset Explorer. Then either select an extension from the list that appears or paste a GitHub URL for an extension repository in the text input and press Enter.

### ~ hint

#### Online dependencies

You must be connected to the internet in order to download and install MakeCode extensions needed by your projects.

### ~

After you add an extension to your project, an entry for it will automatically appear inside your `pxt.json` file.

### Removing an extension from a project

To remove an extension, run the "MakeCode: Remove an extension" command in the VS Code command palette and select the extension to remove.

### Reinstalling project extensions

If you manually edited your project's `pxt.json` file and need to reinstall the project's dependencies, click the "Install project dependencies" command in the ACTIONS section of the MakeCode Asset Explorer.

## Downloading a project to hardware

To compile your project and download it to hardware (e.g. a Meowbit), first run the "Compile project to uf2/hex" command in the ACTIONS section of the MakeCode Asset Explorer. Once the compile finishes, you can find the generated hex/uf2 file under the `built/` folder in your project workspace. Depending on what hardware you selected to compile for, the file may be under an additional subdirectory (e.g. `built/n3/binary.hex`). The file will be named either `binary.hex` or `binary.uf2`.

### Flashing hardware from native VS Code

1. Right click on the uf2/hex file in your `built/` folder and select "Reveal in File Explorer" or "Reveal in Finder" to locate the downloaded file on your computer:

  ![Screenshot of VS Code with the right-click context menu open over the file binary.uf2](/static/vscode/reveal-in-file-explorer.png)

2. Connect your hardware to the computer with a USB cable. It should appear as a USB drive in your computer's file explorer. If you don't see the USB drive, see "Troubleshooting hardware connections" below.
3. Drag the file you located into the USB drive for your hardware. It should automatically reset and load with your compiled game.

### Flashing hardware from vscode.dev

1. Right click on the uf2/hex file in your `built/` folder and select "Download..." to download the uf2/hex file to your computer:

  ![Screenshot of VS Code with the right-click context menu open over the file binary.hex](/static/vscode/download-hex.png)

2. Connect your hardware to the computer with a USB cable. It should appear as a USB drive in your computer's file explorer. If you don't see the USB drive, see "Troubleshooting hardware connections" below.
3. Drag the file you downloaded into the USB drive for your hardware. It should automatically reset and load with your compiled game.

### Troubleshooting hardware connections

If your hardware is failing to show up as a USB drive when you plug it in, try the following steps:

1. Try a different USB cable (some USB cables are power-only and will not allow data transfer).
2. Try updating the firmware for your device. Follow the manufacturer's instructions for how to do this with your device.
3. As a last resort, try a different computer. There may be a device policy in place that is restricting access to USB ports.


## Sharing your project

To create a share link for your project, click the "Create a share link" command in the MakeCode Asset Explorer. This will cause the output pane to open with a link that you can copy/paste. 

To change the name of your shared project, see the [pxt.json](#project-settings-pxt-json) section above.
