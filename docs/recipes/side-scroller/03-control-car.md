# Jump your car

## {Introduction @unplugged}

Use a controller button to jump your car over obstacles on the race course.

## {Step 1 - Add Jump when button pressed}

When the player presses button **A**, we want our car to be able to jump over the obstacles.

From the ``||controller:Controller||`` Toolbox drawer, drag a ``||controller:on A button||`` pressed block onto the Workspace.

```blocks
controller.A.onEvent(ControllerButtonEvent.Pressed, function () {

})
```

## {Step 2 - Check that car is on road}

We only want to be able to jump when our car is on the road – no flying cars! So we need to add a check.

From the ``||logic:Logic||`` Toolbox drawer, drag an ``||logic:if then||`` block into the ``||controller:on A button||`` pressed block.

```blocks
controller.A.onEvent(ControllerButtonEvent.Pressed, function () {
    if (true) {

    }
})
```

## {Step 3 - Check for walls}

From the ``||scene:Scene||`` Toolbox drawer, drag a ``||scene:is mySprite hitting wall||`` block, and drop into the ``||logic:if then||`` block replacing true. Click on the drop-down menu and select ``||scene:bottom||`` for the wall direction.

```blocks
let mySprite: Sprite = null
controller.A.onEvent(ControllerButtonEvent.Pressed, function () {
    if (mySprite.isHittingTile(CollisionDirection.Bottom)) {

    }
})
```

## {Step 4 - Make car jump}

From the ``||sprites:Sprites||`` Toolbox drawer, drag a ``||sprites:set mySprite x to 0||`` block into the ``||logic:if then||`` block.

Click on the ``||sprites:x||`` property drop-down menu and select ``||sprites:vy (velocity y)||`` along the Y vertical axis. Set the value to be ``-200``. This will set the speed of our car to be moving up to jump.

```blocks
let mySprite: Sprite = null
controller.A.onEvent(ControllerButtonEvent.Pressed, function () {
    if (mySprite.isHittingTile(CollisionDirection.Bottom)) {
        mySprite.vy = -200
    }
})
```

## {Step 5 - Add overlaps behavior}

When our car runs into an obstacle, we should lose the game. And when our car runs into the finish line we should win the game. To write that code, we need to use ``||scene:sprite overlaps tile||`` blocks.

From the ``||scene:Scene||`` Toolbox drawer, drag two ``||scene:on sprite of kind overlaps tile||`` blocks onto the Workspace.

## {Step 6 - Specify obstacle and finish line tiles}

In the first ``||scene:on sprite of kind overlaps tile||`` block, click on the checkered square drop-down menu and select your Obstacle tile.

In the second ``||scene:on sprite of kind overlaps tile||`` block, click on the checkered square drop-down menu and select your Finish Line tile.

```blocks
scene.onOverlapTile(SpriteKind.Player, myTiles.tile1, function (sprite, location) {

})
scene.onOverlapTile(SpriteKind.Player, sprites.dungeon.greenOuterEast0, function (sprite, location) {

})
```

## {Step 7 - Game over}

From the ``||game:Game||`` Toolbox drawer, drag **two** ``||game:game over||`` blocks onto the Workspace – drop one into each of the ``||scene:on sprite of kind overlaps tile||`` blocks.

In the second ``||scene:on sprite of kind overlaps tile||`` Finish Line block, toggle the ``||game:game over||`` setting to **WIN**.

```blocks
scene.onOverlapTile(SpriteKind.Player, myTiles.tile1, function (sprite, location) {
    game.over(false)
})
scene.onOverlapTile(SpriteKind.Player, sprites.dungeon.greenOuterEast0, function (sprite, location) {
    game.over(true)
})
```

## {Conclusion - Play your game! @unplugged}

That’s it! Try playing your game in the full screen simulator – jump over obstacles to make it to the finish line! Next you can try adding different types of obstacles, or adding platforms for your car to jump onto.
