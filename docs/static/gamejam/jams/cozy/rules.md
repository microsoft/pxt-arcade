## Cozy Jam

The theme for this jam is "cozy games". What is a [cozy game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cozy_game), you might ask? Well, it's any game that focuses on creating a relaxing atmosphere rather than a stressful one.
Cozy games are often about building things, exploring the world, or expressing yourself instead of limited lives, time limits, or difficulty.
Cozy games can also be a game that just has a real cozy vibe! Think warm mugs of hot cocoa, friendly conversations with neighbors, soft pastel colors... you get the idea!


Does that mean your game can't feature *any* action? Of course it doesn't! As long as your game has that cozy vibe we're looking for, you can have as much action as you want. Just be prepared to defend the coziness of your game!

Some valid interpretations of this theme include:

* A farming simulator where you plant crops and interact with people in a small town like in [Harvest Moon][harvest-moon], [Stardew Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardew_Valley), [Rune Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rune_Factory), or [Fields of Mistria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_of_Mistria)
* A relaxing puzzle solving game like [Monument Valley][monument-valley], [Lumines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumines), [A Monster's Expedition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Monster's_Expedition), or [Dorfromantik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorfromantik)
* A sandbox game that lets you create music or art like in [Tiny Glade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_Glade), [Electroplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroplankton), [Tilt Brush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilt_Brush), or [Mario Paint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Paint)

Feel free to subvert the genre as well. For example, a game that starts out as a cozy game full of happy animal villagers and then subtly turns into some sort of horror game nightmare over time would be a valid interpretation.

You can interpret "cozy" however you want, but someone playing your game should be able to see how it relates to the theme without extra explanation.
