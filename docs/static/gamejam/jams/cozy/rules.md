[Rhythm Code!](https://arcade.makecode.com/40921-79622-15624-16091) by **InvalidProject** features not just one, but THREE whole rhythm games to test your timing skills! Our judges loved the artwork, music, and rating system of this submission. Plus, rumor has it that each of these games is based on a different member of the MakeCode forums...

[The Forest Campfire](https://arcade.makecode.com/50763-65106-55406-25942) by **Freast & Toast** is a delightful game where you complete quests to help out a goofy cast of characters on a camping trip. Our judges were absolutely *floored* by the character art in this game and how polished all of the dialog looked. Not only that, but the writing left us grinning like maniacs through the whole thing! If you like this game, make sure to check out another of Freast's games: [One Night At Scary Gary's](https://arcade.makecode.com/S07056-15018-00192-01563) (which is decidedly less cozy but *is* mentioned in an easter egg of this game).

> **Note from Richard**: "Games that feature me as a character receive no preferential treatment in game jam judging but also it doesn't hurt either."

[The Joy of Pixels](https://arcade.makecode.com/08245-57951-20701-25721) by **Jedi** is a painting sandbox game where you can create and save artworks made out of pixels! The attention to detail in this game is what impressed our judges the most; you can press the menu button to cycle through multiple modes where you can control things like your brush size, speed, and color as well as how zoomed in the canvas is. Plus, the setting is the very definition of coziness!
