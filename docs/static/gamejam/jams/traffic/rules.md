[Square Rescue](https://arcade.makecode.com/25787-41781-39930-98285) by donnadie has it all: an awesome opening, evil triangles, and a core mechanic that's easy to understand but has a lot of depth. It's the best kind of difficult that makes your brain bend in interesting ways to learn how to win. It might take a while to figure out, but keep playing. The satisfaction of rescuing those squares is worth it.

## Second Place: HONK!

Unsigned_Arduino's [HONK!](https://arcade.makecode.com/97928-66031-26500-83480) is, at it's heart, a game that is just incredibly *fun* to play! Take a moment to enjoy the creative title screen and instructions sequence, then press the **A button** to HONK! other cars out of your way. Keep an eye out for powerups as you speed up--you'll need them!

[Traffic Panic](https://arcade.makecode.com/09285-20655-41262-50777) from I Am Penguin is a well-designed and thoughtful puzzler with a high difficulty curve. Arrange the randomly generated road segments into a continuous street before the cars arrive! Later levels introduce new mechanics like trees, or slow-down lights that can give you a little more time to quickly lay out roads.
