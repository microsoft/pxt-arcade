## Prehistoric Jam

The theme for this jam is "prehistoric". In other words, we're looking for games starring dinosaurs, sabertooth tigers, or really just about anything from a long, long, time ago.
Some examples of good interpretations of this theme are:

1. A paleontology game where you unearth and clean fossils for a museum
2. A survival game where a time-travel experiment strands you in the past
3. A fighting game where you play as a dinosaur boxing with an anthropomorphized meteor

You can interpret "prehistoric" however you want, but someone playing your game should be able to see how it relates to the theme without extra explanation.

## Hurry before this jam is *history*
