This Women's History Month, we are excited to partner with Girls Who Code and Code Ninjas to celebrate women who have made an impact in your life through the Female Gamechangers Game Jam!

The theme for this jam is "Women who impacted your life". Your game could include a famous woman from history, someone you know personally, or even an original character you create!

Some examples of good interpretations of this theme:

1. A game that traces the journey of Amelia Earhart
2. A sports game featuring female athletes
3. A space exploration game inspired by the life of NASA mathematician Katherine Johnson

You can interpret the theme however you want, but someone playing your game should be able to see how it relates to the theme without extra explanation.

Be sure to also check out the [official Code Ninja's page for this jam](https://forms.codeninjas.com/femalegamechangers) to learn about how you can be entered to win prizes if you're under 16!
