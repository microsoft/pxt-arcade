## Heist Jam

The theme for this jam is "Heists". In other words, we're looking for games about thievery, rogues, and crime!

Does that mean your game has to be about robbing banks? Not at all! Your game could be about metaphorically stealing something (like hearts or minds), or it could simply have a plot that is set in motion by a heist that happened before the game even started. Feel free to get creative!

Some good interpretations of this theme:

* A game where you control a rabbit stealing crops from a curmudgeonly farmer
* A fantasy game where you have to recover a kingdom's stolen amulet
* A dating game where you have to steal the hearts of suitors
* ...and of course a game where you rob a bank

You can interpret "heists" however you want, but someone playing your game should be able to see how it relates to the theme without extra explanation. If you're worried we won't *get* it, then put it in the game title or description when you submit!

## Don't stress! You've got plenty of time
The game jam will run from **October 1, 2025** to **November 15, 2025**

For you procrastinators out there, we will accept submissions until 11:59 PM PDT on November 15th!
