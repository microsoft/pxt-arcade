[The Safe Cracker](https://arcade.makecode.com/50932-20209-20218-60886) by **Teddy B.** is a masterclass in making you really stressed out which is exactly what I assume it's like to actually participate in a real heist! You need to juggle three simultaneous challenges all while a relentless timer just keeps ticking and ticking and ticking and oh my god it never stops and I just lost all of my progress and WHAT AM I GOING TO D-

Ahem... Our judges loved this *gem* of a game because of its clever premise, killer music, and overall stylishness. The opening cutscene and UI are full of little touches that are a delight to discover. Like all Teddy B. games, this one is well worth your time!

[Under Surveillance](https://arcade.makecode.com/52784-59082-24354-89134) by **Bilangus** has one of the most addictive loops of any of the submissions we received for this jam. You play as a thief who is committing a series of robberies; each time you return from a heist you can invest your ill-gotten gains to unlock new skills or improve your thief's stats. And boy there are a lot of skills! Our judges loved mixing and matching the different skill options to find the best combo for their playstyle (luckily, the actual missions in this game are so quick to complete that you can quickly generate the funds to try out all of the available options).

This game is also jam-packed with all sorts of heist-y details: you can climb through vents, use smoke screens, avoid security cameras, and each of the missions has a distinct environment and objectives to steal. Plus, there's no penalty for messing up so it totally convinced us that being a thief is super fun with no downsides whatsoever.

[Nine Cores](https://arcade.makecode.com/24442-87185-99963-39751) by **Rune** is one of the best "twin stick shooter" type games that we've seen in MakeCode Arcade! The combat feels really good... *really, really* good. And the minimal graphics give the game a great streamlined feel. Combine that with the awesome music and addictive upgrade cycle and you've got yourself a recipe for a game with lots of replay value! Just be aware, the timing is *tight* on the getaway for this heist.

[Katandra: Hollow Heist](https://arcade.makecode.com/99904-43074-40676-04519) by **CopySprite** is a stylish platformer where you slash enemies and avoid obstacles in your quest to steal the mysterious "Void Amulet". What really set this game apart was the visuals, which all of our judges loved, and the multiple weapons and enemy types that you encounter along the way. We've also been assured by CopySprite that there are a number of secrets to discover in the game, so make sure you keep your eyes peeled as you're fighting off hordes of oni!
