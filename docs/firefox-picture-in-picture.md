# Picture-in-Picture on Firefox

Tutorials, skillmaps, or other content in Makecode Arcade may have illustrative videos which overlap their page. The browser can set these into a web page as Picture-in-Picture videos. Many browsers display these videos directly in the current page without any control actions from the user. In the Firefox browser, the Picture-in-Picture feature has special controls that let you move the video off of the page, view full screen, etc. To view and keep the video on the Makecode Arcade page, you may need to make changes to the settings for Picture-in-Picture in Firefox.

## Keep the video in place

While using Makecode Arcade and viewing the videos on it's pages, it is probably best to disable the Picture-in-Picture feature for the videos. This will let you have the full view of your activity while still seeing the video play. You should remember to re-enable Picture-in-Picture for the browser when you're finished using Makecode.

There are two ways to keep your video in place on the web page:

### Hide the Picture-in-Picture toggle

You can hide the Picture-in-Picture toggle with a right click of the mouse on the Picture-in-Picture icon shown on top of the video.

## Reset Picture-in-Picture settings

After using Makecode, remember to re-enable the **"Enable picture-in-picture video controls"** setting in **"Settings"** under the browser menu if you want to have Picture-in-Picture controls for videos in other web pages.
