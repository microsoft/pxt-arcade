# Properties

Properties that control the path of the dart.

## angle

The angle of throw incidence.

### get

```block
let myDart: Dart = null
let angle = myDart.angle
```

### set

```block
let myDart: Dart = null
myDart.angle = 10
```

## pow

The throwing force applied to the dart.

### get

```block
let myDart: Dart = null
let power = myDart.pow
```

### set

```block
let myDart: Dart = null
myDart.pow = 50
```

## gravity

The down force applied to the dart while it travels.

### get

```block
let myDart: Dart = null
let gravity = myDart.gravity
```

### set

```block
let myDart: Dart = null
myDart.gravity = 20
```

## wind

The horizontal force pushing on the dart.

### get

```block
let myDart: Dart = null
let wind = myDart.wind
```

### set

```block
let myDart: Dart = null
myDart.wind = 0
```

## traceColor

The color of the trace line for the dart.

### get

```block
let myDart: Dart = null
let traceColor = myDart.traceColor
```

### set

```block
let myDart: Dart = null
myDart.traceColor = 1
```

## angleRate

The rate the throw angle is changed by control of the arrow keys.

### get

```block
let myDart: Dart = null
let angleRate = myDart.angleRate
```

### set

```block
let myDart: Dart = null
myDart.angleRate = 1
```

## powerRate

The rate the throw power is changed by control of the arrow keys.

### get

```block
let myDart: Dart = null
let powerRate = myDart.powerRate
```

### set

```block
let myDart: Dart = null
myDart.powerRate = 1
```

## iter

The resolution of the trace line shown for the dart path.

### get

```block
let myDart: Dart = null
let iter = myDart.iter
```

### set

```block
let myDart: Dart = null
myDart.iter = 3
```
